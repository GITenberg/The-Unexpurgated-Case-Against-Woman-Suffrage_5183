<p><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I<font size="-1">T </font>has come to be believed that
 everything <br>
  that has a bearing upon the concession of the <br>
  suffrage to woman has already been brought <br>
  forward. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In reality, however, the influence of women <br>
  has caused man to leave unsaid many things <br>
  which he ought to have said. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially in two respects has woman re- <br>
  stricted the discussion. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has placed her taboo upon all general- <br>
  isations about women, taking exception to <br>
  these on the threefold ground that there would <br>
  be no generalisations which would hold true of <br>
  all women; that generalisations when reached <br>
  possess no practical utility; and that the ele- <br>
  ment of sex does not leave upon women any <br>
  general imprint such as could properly be <br>
  brought up in connexion with the question of <br>
  admitting them to the electorate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 11 <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Woman has further stifled discussion by <br>
  placing her taboo upon anything seriously un- <br>
  flattering being said about her in public. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would suggest, and would propose here <br>
  myself to act upon the suggestion, that, in con- <br>
  nexion with the discussion of woman's suf- <br>
  frage, these restrictions should be laid <br>
  aside. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In connexion with the setting aside of the <br>
  restriction upon generalising, I may perhaps <br>
  profitably point out that all generalisations, <br>
  and not only generalisations which relate to <br>
  women, are <i>ex hypothesi</i> <i>[by hypothesis]</i> subject to individual
 <br>
  exceptions. (It is to generalisations that the <br>
  proverb that "the exception proves the rule" <br>
  really applies.)&nbsp; I may further point out that <br>
  practically every decision which we take in or- <br>
  dinary life, and all legislative action without <br>
  exception, is based upon generalisations; and <br>
  again, that the question of the suffrage, and <br>
  with it the larger question as to the proper <br>
  sphere of woman, finally turns upon the ques- <br>
  tion as to what imprint woman's sexual sys-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 12 <br>
  tem leaves upon her physical frame, character, <br>
  and intellect: in more technical terms, it turns <br>
  upon the question as to what are the <i>secondary</i> <br>
  <i>sexual character[istic]s</i> of woman. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now only by a felicitous exercise of the fac- <br>
  ulty of successful generalisation can we arrive <br>
  at a knowledge of these. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With respect to the restriction that nothing <br>
  which might offend woman's <i>amour propre [self love]</i> <br>
  shall be said in public, it may be pointed out <br>
  that, while it was perfectly proper and equit- <br>
  able that no evil (and, as Pericles proposed, <br>
  also no good) should be said of woman in pub- <br>
  lic so long as she confined herself to the do- <br>
  mestic sphere, the action of that section of <br>
  women who have sought to effect an entrance <br>
  into public life, has now brought down upon <br>
  woman, as one of the penalties, the abrogation <br>
  of that convention. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A consideration which perhaps ranks only <br>
  next in importance to that with which we have <br>
  been dealing, is that of the logical sanction of <br>
  the propositions which are enunciated in the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 13 <br>
  course of such controversial discussions as that <br>
  in which we are here involved. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is clearly a precondition of all useful dis- <br>
  cussion that the author and reader should be in <br>
  accord with respect to the authority of the gen- <br>
  eralisations and definitions which supply the <br>
  premisses for his reasonings. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though this might perhaps to the reader <br>
  appear an impractical ideal, I would propose <br>
  here to attempt to reach it by explaining the <br>
  logical method which I have set myself to fol- <br>
  low. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although I have from literary necessity em- <br>
  ployed in my text some of the verbal forms of <br>
  dogmatism, I am very far from laying claim <br>
  to any dogmatic authority.&nbsp; More than that, I <br>
  would desire categorically to repudiate such a <br>
  claim. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For I do not conceal from myself that, if I <br>
  took up such a position, I should wantonly be <br>
  placing myself at the mercy of my reader. <br>
  For he could then, by merely refusing to see&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 14 <br>
  in me an authority, bring down the whole edi- <br>
  fice of my argument like a house of cards. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover I am not blind to what would hap- <br>
  pen if, after I claimed to be taken as an author- <br>
  ity, the reader was indulgent enough still to go <br>
  on to read what I have written. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He would in such a case, the moment he en- <br>
  countered a statement with which he disagreed, <br>
  simply waive me on one side with the words, <br>
  "So you say." <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And if he should encounter a statement with <br>
  which he agreed, he would in his wisdom, cen- <br>
  sure me for neglecting to provide for that <br>
  proposition a satisfactory logical founda- <br>
  tion. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it is far from my thoughts to claim a right <br>
  of dictation, it is equally remote from them to <br>
  take up the position that I have in my argu- <br>
  ments furnished <i>proof</i> of the thesis which <br>
  I set out to establish. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be culpable misuse of language to <br>
  speak in such connexion of <i>proof</i> or <i>disproof</i> .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 15 <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proof by testimony, which is available in con- <br>
  nexion with questions of fact, is unavailable in <br>
  connexion with general truths; and logical <br>
  proof is obtainable only in that comparatively <br>
  narrow sphere where reasoning is based--as in <br>
  mathematics--upon axioms, or--as in certain <br>
  really crucial experiments in the mathematic <br>
  sciences--upon quasi-axiomatic premisses. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everywhere else we base our reasonings on <br>
  premisses which are simply more or less prob- <br>
  able; and accordingly the conclusions which <br>
  we arrive at have in them always an element <br>
  of insecurity. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be clear that in philosophy, in juris- <br>
  prudence, in political economy and sociology, <br>
  and in literary criticism and such like, we are <br>
  dealing not with certainties but with proposi- <br>
  tions which are, for literary convenience, in- <br>
  vested with the garb of certainties. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What kind of logical sanction is it, then, <br>
  which can attach to reasonings such as are to <br>
  be set out here? <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have in point of fact the sanction which&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 16 <br>
  attaches to reasonings based upon premisses <br>
  arrived at by the method of <i>diacritical judg-</i> <br>
  <i>ment.</i> <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is, I hasten to notify the reader, not the <br>
  method, but only the name here assigned to it, <br>
  which is unfamiliar.&nbsp; As soon as I exhibit it <br>
  in the working, the reader will identify it as <br>
  that by which every generalisation and defini- <br>
  tion ought to be put to the proof. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I may for this purpose take the general <br>
  statements or definitions which serve as prem- <br>
  isses for my reasonings in the text. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I bring forward those generalisations and <br>
  definitions because they commend themselves <br>
  to my diacritical judgment.&nbsp; In other words, I <br>
  set them forth as results which have been <br>
  reached after reiterated efforts to call up to <br>
  mind the totality of my experience, and to de- <br>
  tect the factor which is common to all the in- <br>
  dividual experiences. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When for instance I propose a definition, I <br>
  have endeavoured to call to mind all the dif- <br>
  ferent uses of the word with which I am fa-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 17 <br>
  miliar--eliminating, of course, all the obviously <br>
  incorrect uses. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And when I venture to attempt a generalisa- <br>
  tion about woman, I endeavour to recall to <br>
  mind without distinction all the different <br>
  women I have encountered, and to extricate <br>
  from my impressions what was common to all, <br>
  --omitting from consideration (except only <br>
  when I am dealing specifically with these) all <br>
  plainly abnormal women. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having by this procedure arrived at a gen- <br>
  eralisation--which may of course be correct <br>
  or incorrect--I submit it to my reader, and <br>
  ask from him that he should, after going <br>
  through the same mental operations as myself, <br>
  review my judgment, and pronounce his ver- <br>
  dict. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it should then so happen that the reader <br>
  comes, in the case of any generalisation, to the <br>
  same verdict as that which I have reached, that <br>
  particular generalisation will, I submit, now <br>
  go forward not as a datum of my individual <br>
  experience, but as the intellectual resultant of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 18 <br>
  two separate and distinct experiences.&nbsp; It will <br>
  thereby be immensely fortified. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If, on the other hand, the reader comes to <br>
  the conclusion that a particular generalisation <br>
  is out of conformity with his experience, that <br>
  generalisation will go forward shorn of some, <br>
  or perchance all, its authority. <br>

  or fails to find, acceptance among the thought- <br>
  ful, be endorsed as a truth, and be gathered <br>
  into the garner of human knowledge; or be <br>
  recognised as an error, and find its place with <br>
  the tares, which the householder, in time of the <br>
  harvest, will tell the reapers to bind in bundles <br>
  to burn them. <br>

<p><font size="-1">Programme of this Treatise--Motives&nbsp; from which</font>
   <br>
  <font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Women Claim the Suffrage--Types
 of Men who</font> <br>
  <font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Support the
Suffrage--John  Stuart Mill.</font> </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T<font size="-1">HE</font> task which I undertake here
 is to show <br>
  that the Woman's Suffrage Movement has no <br>
  real intellectual or moral sanction, and that <br>
  there are very weighty reasons why the suf- <br>
  frage should not be conceded to woman. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would propose to begin by analysing the <br>
  mental attitude of those who range themselves <br>
  on the side of woman suffrage, and then to pass <br>
  on to deal with the principal arguments upon <br>
  which the woman suffragist relies. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The preponderating majority of the women <br>
  who claim the suffrage do not do so from mo- <br>
  tives of public interest or philanthropy. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are influenced almost exclusively by <br>
  two motives: resentment at the suggestion that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 21 <br>
  woman should be accounted by man as inher- <br>
  ently his inferior in certain important re- <br>
  spects; and reprehension of a state of society <br>
  in which more money, more personal liberty <br>
  (In reality only more of the personal liberty <br>
  which the possession of money confers), more <br>
  power, more public recognition and happier <br>
  physiological conditions fall to the share of <br>
  man. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A cause which derives its driving force so <br>
  little from philanthropy and public interest <br>
  and so much from offended <i>amour propre</i> and <br>
  pretensions which are, as we shall see, unjusti- <br>
  fied, has in reality no moral prestige. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For its intellectual prestige the movement <br>
  depends entirely on the fact that it has the <br>
  advocacy of a certain number of distinguished <br>
  men. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will not be amiss to examine that ad- <br>
  vocacy. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The "intellectual" whose name appears at <br>
  the foot of woman's suffrage petitions will, <br>
  when you have him by himself, very often&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 22 <br>
  Make confession:--"Woman suffrage," he <br>
  will tell you, "is not the grave and important <br>
  cause which the ardent female suffragist <br>
  deems it to be.&nbsp; Not only will it not do any <br>
  of the things which she imagines it is going to <br>
  do, but it will leave the world exactly where <br>
  it is.&nbsp; Still--the concession of votes to women <br>
  is desirable&nbsp; from the&nbsp; point of view of sym- <br>
  metry of classification; and it will soothe the <br>
  ruffled feelings of quite a number of&nbsp; very <br>
  worthy women." <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It may be laid down as a broad general rule <br>
  that only two classes of men have the cause of <br>
  woman's suffrage really at heart. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first is the crank who, as soon as he <br>
  thinks he has discerned a moral principle, im- <br>
  mediately gets into the saddle, and then rides <br>
  hell-for-leather, reckless of all considerations <br>
  of public expediency. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second is that very curious type of man, <br>
  who when it is suggested in his hearing that the <br>
  species woman is, measured by certain intel- <br>
  lectual and moral standards, the inferior of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 23 <br>
  species man, solemnly draws himself up and <br>
  asks, "Are you, sir, aware that you are insult- <br>
  ing my wife?" <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To this, the type of man who feels every un- <br>
  favourable criticism of woman as a personal <br>
  affront to himself, John Stuart Mill, had <br>
  affinities. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We find him writing a letter to the Home <br>
  Secretary, informing him, in relation to a Par- <br>
  liamentary Bill restricting the sale of arsenic <br>
  to male persons over twenty-one years, that it <br>
  was a "gross insult to every woman, all women <br>
  from highest to lowest being deemed unfit to <br>
  have poison in their possession, lest they shall <br>
  commit murder." <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We find him again, in a state of indignation <br>
  with the English marriage laws, preluding his <br>
  nuptials with Mrs. Taylor by presenting that <br>
  lady with a formal charter; renouncing all au- <br>
  thority over her, and promising her security <br>
  against all infringements of her liberty which <br>
  might proceed from<i> himself</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 24 <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To this lady he is always ascribing credit for <br>
  his eminent intellectual achievements.&nbsp; And <br>
  lest his reader should opine that woman stands <br>
  somewhat in the shade with respect to her own <br>
  intellectual&nbsp; triumphs, Mill undertakes the <br>
  explanation.&nbsp; "Felicitous thoughts," he tells <br>
  us, "occur by hundreds to every woman of in- <br>
  tellect.&nbsp; But they are mostly lost for want of a <br>
  husband or friend&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; to estimate them <br>
  properly, and to bring them before the world; <br>
  and even when they are brought before it they <br>
  generally appear as his ideas." <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only did Mill see woman and all her <br>
  works through an optical medium which gave <br>
  images like this; but there was upon his ret- <br>
  ina a large blind area.&nbsp; By reason of this <br>
  last it was inapprehensible to him that there <br>
  could be an objection to the sexes co-operating <br>
  indiscriminately in work.&nbsp; It was beyond his <br>
  ken that the sex element would under these <br>
  conditions invade whole departments of life <br>
  which are now free from it.&nbsp; As he saw things,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 25 <br>
  there was in point of fact a risk of the human <br>
  race dying out by reason of the inadequate im- <br>
  perativeness of its sexual instincts. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mill's unfaithfulness to the facts cannot, <br>
  however, all be put down to constitutional de- <br>
  fects of vision.&nbsp; When he deals with woman <br>
  he is no longer scrupulously conscientious. <br>
  We begin to have our suspicions of his up- <br>
  rightness when we find him in his <i>Subjection</i> <br>
  <i>of Women</i> laying it down as a fundamental <br>
  postulate that the subjection of woman to man <br>
  is always morally indefensible.&nbsp; For no up- <br>
  right mind can fail to see that the woman who <br>
  lives in a condition of financial dependence <br>
  upon man has no moral claim to unrestricted <br>
  liberty.&nbsp; The suspicion of Mill's honesty <br>
  which is thus awakened is confirmed by <br>
  further critical reading of his treatise.&nbsp; In <br>
  that skilful tractate one comes across, every <br>
  here and there, a <i>suggestio falsi [suggestion of a falsehood],</i> or
a <i>sup-</i>  <br>
  <i>pressio veri [suppression of the truth],</i> or a fallacious analogy
nebulously  <br>
  expressed, or a mendacious metaphor, or a <br>
  passage which is contrived to lead off attention&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 26 <br>
  from some weak point in the feminist case.<sup><font size="-1"><small>1</small></font></sup>
   <br>
  Moreover, Mill was unmindful of the obliga- <br>
  tions of intellectual morality when he allowed <br>
  his stepdaughter, in connexion with feminist <br>
  questions, to draft letters <sup><small>2</small></sup> which went forward
<br>
  as his own. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is yet another factor which must be <br>
  kept in mind in connexion with the writings <br>
  of Mill.&nbsp; It was the special characteristic of <br>
  the man to set out to tackle concrete problems <br>
  and then to spend his strength upon abstrac- <br>
  tions. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his <i>Political Economy</i>, where his proper <br>
  subject matter was man with his full equip- <br>
  ment of impulses, Mill took as his theme an <br>
  abstraction: an <i>economic man</i> who is actuated <br>
  solely by the desire of gain.&nbsp; He then worked <br>
  out in great elaboration the course of conduct <br>
  which an aggregate of these puppets of his <br>
  imagination would pursue.&nbsp; Having&nbsp; per-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>suaded himself, after this, that he had in his <br>
  possession a <i>vade mecum</i> <i>[handbook]</i> to the comprehension <br>
  of human societies, he now took it upon him- <br>
  self&nbsp; to expound the principles which govern <br>
  and direct these.&nbsp; Until such time as this pro- <br>
  cedure was unmasked, Mill's political econ- <br>
  omy enjoyed an unquestioned authority. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exactly the same plan was followed by Mill <br>
  in handling the question of woman's suffrage. <br>
  Instead of dealing with woman as she is, and <br>
  with woman placed in a setting of actually sub- <br>
  sisting conditions, Mill takes as his theme a <br>
  woman who is a creature of his imagination. <br>
  This woman is, <i>by assumption</i>, in mental en- <br>
  dowments a replica of man.&nbsp; She lives in a <br>
  world which is, <i>by tacit assumption</i>, free from <br>
  complications of sex.&nbsp; And, if practical con- <br>
  siderations had ever come into the purview of <br>
  Mill's mind, she would, <i>by tacit assumption</i>, be <br>
  paying her own way, and be making full per- <br>
  sonal and financial contributions to the State. <br>
  It is in connexion with this fictitious woman <br>
  that Mill sets himself to work out the benefits&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 28 <br>
  which women would derive from co-partner- <br>
  ship with men in the government of the State, <br>
  and those which such co-partnership would <br>
  confer on the community.&nbsp; Finally, practis- <br>
  ing again upon himself the same imposition as <br>
  in his <i>Political Economy</i>, this unpractical <br>
  trafficker in abstractions sets out to persuade <br>
  his reader that he has, by dealing with fictions <br>
  of the mind, effectively grappled with the <br>
  concrete problem of woman's suffrage. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, then, is the philosopher who gives in- <br>
  tellectual prestige to the Woman's Suffrage <br>
  cause. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But is there not, let us in the end ask our- <br>
  selves, here and there at least, a man who is of <br>
  real account in the world of affairs, and who <br>
  is--not simply a luke-warm Platonic friend or <br>
  an opportunist advocate--but an impassioned <br>
  promoter of the woman's suffrage movement? <br>
  One knows quite well that there is.&nbsp; But <br>
  then one suspects--one perhaps discerns by <br>
  "the spirit sense"--that this impassioned pro- <br>
  moter of woman's suffrage is, on the sequest-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 29 <br>
  ered side of his life, an idealistic dreamer: one <br>
  for whom some woman's memory has become, <br>
  like Beatrice for Dante, a mystic religion. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may now pass on to deal with the argu- <br>
  ments by which the woman suffragist has <br>
  sought to establish her case.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; L<font size="-1">ET US</font> note that the suffragist
 does not-- <br>
  except, perhaps, when she is addressing her- <br>
  self to unfledged girls and to the sexually em- <br>
  bittered--really produce much effect by in- <br>
  veighing against the legal grievances of woman <br>
  under the bastardy laws, the divorce laws, and <br>
  the law which fixes the legal age of consent. <br>
  This kind of appeal does not go down with the <br>
  ordinary man and woman--first, because there <br>
  are many who think that in spite of occasional <br>
  hardships the public advantage is, on the whole, <br>
  very well served by the existing laws; secondly,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 33 <br>
  because any alterations which might be desir- <br>
  able could very easily be made without recourse <br>
  to woman's suffrage; and thirdly, because the <br>
  suffragist consistently acts on the principle of <br>
  bringing up against man everything that can <br>
  possibly be brought up against him, and of <br>
  never allowing anything to appear on the credit <br>
  side of the ledger. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The arguments which the woman suffragist <br>
  really places confidence in are those which are <br>
  provided by undefined general principles, <br>
  apothegms set out in the form of axioms, form- <br>
  ul&aelig; which are vehicles for fallacies, ambigu- <br>
  ous abstract terms, and "question-begging" <br>
  epithets.&nbsp; Your ordinary unsophisticated man <br>
  and woman stand almost helpless against argu- <br>
  ments of this kind. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For these bring to bear moral pressure upon <br>
  human nature.&nbsp; And when the intellect is con- <br>
  fused by a word or formula which conveys an <br>
  ethical appeal, one may very easily find one- <br>
  self committed to action which one's unbiased <br>
  reason would never have approved.&nbsp; The very&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 34 <br>
  first requirement in connexion with any word <br>
  or phrase which conveys a moral exhortation <br>
  is, therefore, to analyse it and find out its true <br>
  signification.&nbsp; For all such concepts as justice, <br>
  rights, freedom, chivalry--and it is with these <br>
  that we shall be specially concerned--are, when <br>
  properly defined and understood beacon-lights, <br>
  but when ill understood and undefined, stum- <br>
  bling-blocks in the path of humanity. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may appropriately begin by analys- <br>
  ing the term "Woman's Rights" and the cor- <br>
  relative formula "Woman has a right to the <br>
  suffrage." <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our attention here immediately focuses upon <br>
  the term <i>right</i>.&nbsp; It is one of the most important <br>
  of the verbal agents by which the suffragist <br>
  hopes to bring moral pressure to bear upon <br>
  man. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, the term <i>right</i> denotes in its juridical
<br>
  sense a debt which is owed to us by the State. <br>
  A right is created when the community binds <br>
  itself to us, its individual members, to intervene <br>
  by force to restrain any one from interfering&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 35 <br>
  with us, and to protect us in the enjoyment of <br>
  our faculties, privileges, and property. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The term is capable of being given a wider <br>
  meaning.&nbsp; While no one could appropriately <br>
  speak of our having a <i>right</i> to health or any- <br>
  thing that man has not the power to bestow, it <br>
  is arguable that there are, independent of and <br>
  antecedent to law, elementary rights: a right <br>
  to freedom; a right to protection against per- <br>
  sonal violence; a right to the protection of our <br>
  property; and a right to the impartial admin- <br>
  istration of regulations which are binding <br>
  upon all.&nbsp; Such a use of the term <i>right</i> could <br>
  be justified on the ground that everybody <br>
  would be willing to make personal sacrifices, <br>
  and to combine with his fellows for the pur- <br>
  pose of securing these essentials--an under- <br>
  standing which would almost amount to legal <br>
  sanction. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The suffragist who employs the term <br>
  "Woman's <i>Rights</i>" does not employ the word <br>
  rights in either of these senses.&nbsp; Her case is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 36 <br>
  analogous to that of a man who should in a <br>
  republic argue about the divine <i>right</i> of kings; <br>
  or that of the Liberal who should argue that <br>
  it was his <i>right</i> to live permanently under a <br>
  Liberal government; or of any member of a <br>
  minority who should, with a view of getting <br>
  what he wants, argue that he was contending <br>
  only for his rights. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman suffragist is merely bluffing. <br>
  Her formula "<i>Woman's Rights</i>" means simply <br>
  "<i>Woman's Claims</i>." <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the moment--for we shall presently be <br>
  coming back to the question of the enforce- <br>
  ment of rights--our task is to examine the <br>
  arguments which the suffragist brings forward <br>
  in support of her claims. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First and chief among these is the argument <br>
  that the<i> Principle of Justice</i> prescribes that <br>
  women should be enfranchised. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we inquire what the suffragist under- <br>
  stands under the Principle of Justice, one re- <br>
  ceives by way of answer only the <i>petitio prin-</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 37 <br>
  <i>cipii [question begging]</i> that Justice is a moral principle which
<br>
  includes woman suffrage among its implica- <br>
  tions. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In reality it is only very few who clearly ap- <br>
  prehend the nature of Justice.&nbsp; For under <br>
  this appellation two quite different principles <br>
  are confounded. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The primary and correct signification of the <br>
  term Justice will perhaps be best arrived at by <br>
  pursuing the following train of considera- <br>
  tions:-- <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When man, long impatient at arbitrary and <br>
  quite incalculable autocratic judgments, pro- <br>
  ceeded to build up a legal system to take the <br>
  place of these, he built it upon the following <br>
  series of axioms:--(<i>a</i>)&nbsp;&nbsp; All actions of which <br>
  the courts are to take cognisance shall be classi- <br>
  fied.&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>b</i>)&nbsp;&nbsp; The legal consequences of each
<br>
  class of action shall be definitely fixed.&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i> c</i>) <br>
  The courts shall adjudicate only on questions <br>
  of fact, and on the issue as to how the particu- <br>
  lar deed which is the cause of action should be <br>
  classified.&nbsp; And (<i>d</i>) such decisions shall carry&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 38 <br>
  with them in an automatic manner the ap- <br>
  pointed legal consequences. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, if a man be arraigned for the <br>
  appropriation of another man's goods, it is an <br>
  axiom that the court (when once the questions <br>
  of fact have been disposed of) shall adjudicate <br>
  only on the issue as to whether the particular <br>
  appropriation of goods in dispute comes un- <br>
  der the denomination of larceny, burglary, or <br>
  other co-ordinate category; and that upon this <br>
  the sentence shall go forth: directing that the <br>
  legal consequences which are appointed to that <br>
  particular class of action be enforced. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the system every one can see ad- <br>
  ministered in every court of justice. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is, however, over and above what has <br>
  just been set out another essential element in <br>
  Justice.&nbsp; It is an element which readily <br>
  escapes the eye. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have in view the fact that the classifications <br>
  which are adopted and embodied in the law <br>
  must not be arbitrary classifications.&nbsp; They <br>
  must all be conformable to the principle of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 39 <br>
  utility, and be directed to the advantage of <br>
  society. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If, for instance, burglary is placed in a class <br>
  apart from larceny, it is discriminated from it <br>
  because this distinction is demanded by con- <br>
  siderations of public advantage.&nbsp; But consid- <br>
  erations of utility would not countenance, and <br>
  by consequence Justice would not accept, a <br>
  classification of theft into theft committed by <br>
  a poor man and theft committed by a rich man. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The conception of Justice is thus everywhere <br>
  interfused with considerations of utility and ex- <br>
  pediency. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will have become plain that if we have in <br>
  view the justice which is administered in the <br>
  courts--we may here term it <i>Juridical Justice</i> <br>
  --then the question as to whether it is <i>just</i> <br>
  to refuse the suffrage to woman will be deter- <br>
  mined by considering whether the classification <br>
  of men as voters and of women as non-voters is <br>
  in the public interest.&nbsp; Put otherwise, the ques- <br>
  tion whether it would be just that woman <br>
  should have a vote would require the answer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 40 <br>
  "Yes" or "No," according as the question <br>
  whether it would be expedient or inexpedient <br>
  that woman should vote required the answer <br>
  "Yes" or "No."&nbsp; But it would be for the elect- <br>
  orate, not for the woman suffragist, to decide <br>
  that question. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is, as already indicated, another prin- <br>
  ciple which passes under the name of Justice. <br>
  I have in view the principle that in the distri- <br>
  bution of wealth or political power, or any <br>
  other privileges which it is in the power of the <br>
  State to bestow, every man should share equally <br>
  with every other man, and every woman <br>
  equally with every man, and that in countries <br>
  where Europeans and natives live side by side, <br>
  these latter should share all privileges equally <br>
  with the white--the goal of endeavour being <br>
  that all distinctions depending upon natural <br>
  endowment, sex, and race should be effaced. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may call this principle the <i>Principle of</i> <br>
  <i>Egalitarian Equity</i>--first, because it aims at <br>
  establishing a quite artificial equality; secondly, <br>
  because it makes appeal to our ethical in-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 41 <br>
  stincts, and claims on that ground to override <br>
  the distinctions of which formal law takes ac- <br>
  count. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But let us reflect that we have here a prin- <br>
  ciple which properly understood, embraces in <br>
  its purview all mankind, and not mankind only <br>
  but also the lower animals.&nbsp; That is to say, we <br>
  have here a principle, which consistently fol- <br>
  lowed out, would make of every man and <br>
  woman <i>in primis</i> <i>[at first] </i>a socialist; then a woman suf-
<br>
  fragist; then a philo-native, negrophil, and an <br>
  advocate of the political rights of natives and <br>
  negroes; and then, by logical compulsion ant <br>
  anti-vivisectionist, who accounts it <i>unjust</i> to <br>
  experiment on an animal; a vegetarian, who <br>
  accounts it <i>unjust</i> to kill animals for food; <br>
  and findly one who, like the Jains, accounts <br>
  it unjust to take the life of even verminous in- <br>
  sects. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we accept this principle of egalitarian <br>
  equity as of absolute obligation, we shall have <br>
  to accept along with woman's suffrage all the <br>
  other "isms" believed in, and agitated for, by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 42 <br>
  the cranks who are so numerously represented <br>
  in the ranks of woman suffragists. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If, on the other hand, we accept the doc- <br>
  trine of egalitarian equity with the qualifica- <br>
  tion that it shall apply only so far as what it <br>
  enjoins is conformable to public advantage, <br>
  we shall again make expediency the criterion of <br>
  the justice of woman's suffrage. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before passing on it will be well to point <br>
  out that the argument from Justice meets us <br>
  not only in the form that Justice requires that <br>
  woman should have a vote, but also in all sorts <br>
  of other forms.&nbsp; We encounter it in the writ- <br>
  ings of publicists, in the formula <i>Taxation</i> <br>
  <i>carries with it a Right to Representation</i>; and <br>
  we encounter it in the streets, on the banners <br>
  of woman suffrage processions, in the form <br>
  <i>Taxation without Representation is Tyranny</i>. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This latter theorem of taxation which is dis- <br>
  played on the banners of woman suffrage is, I <br>
  suppose, deliberately and intentionally a <i>sug-</i> <br>
  <i>gestio falsi</i>.&nbsp; For only that taxation is tyran- <br>
  nous which is diverted to objects which are not&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 43 <br>
  useful to the contributors.&nbsp; And even the suf- <br>
  fragist does not suggest that the taxes which <br>
  are levied on women are differentially applied <br>
  to the uses of men. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Putting, then, this form of argument out <br>
  of sight, let us come to close quarters with the <br>
  question whether the payment of taxes gives <br>
  a title to control the finances of the State. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, if it really did so without any regard <br>
  to the status of the claimant, not only women, <br>
  but also foreigners residing in, or holding <br>
  property in, England, and with these lunatics <br>
  and miners with property, and let me, for the <br>
  sake of a pleasanter collocation of ideas, has- <br>
  tily add peers of the realm, who have now no <br>
  control over public finance, ought to receive <br>
  the parliamentary franchise.&nbsp; And in like <br>
  manner if the payment of a tax, without con- <br>
  sideration of its amount, were to give a title <br>
  to a vote, every one who bought an article <br>
  which had paid a duty would be entitled to a <br>
  vote in his own, or in a foreign, country ac-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 44 <br>
  cording as that duty has been paid at home or <br>
  abroad. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In reality the moral and logical nexus be- <br>
  tween the payment of taxes and the control of <br>
  the public revenue is that the solvent and self- <br>
  supporting citizens, and only these, are en- <br>
  titled to direct its financial policy. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I have not received, or if I have refunded, <br>
  any direct contributions I may have received <br>
  from the coffers of the State; if I have paid <br>
  my <i>pro rata</i> share of its establishment charges <br>
  --<i>i.e.</i> of the costs of both internal administra- <br>
  tion and external defence; and I have further <br>
  paid my proportional share of whatever may <br>
  be required to make up for the deficit incurred <br>
  on account of my fellow-men and women who <br>
  either require direct assistance from the State, <br>
  or cannot meet their share of the expenses of <br>
  the State, I am a <i>solvent citizen</i>; and if I fail <br>
  to meet these liabilities, I am an<i> insolvent cit-</i> <br>
  <i>izen </i>even though I pay such taxes as the State <br>
  insists upon my paying.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 45 <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now if a woman insists, in the face of warn- <br>
  ings that she had better not do so, on taxing <br>
  man with dishonesty for withholding from her <br>
  financial control over the revenues of the <br>
  State, she has only herself to blame if she is <br>
  told very bluntly that her claim to such control <br>
  is barred by the fact that she is, as a citizen <br>
  insolvent.&nbsp; The taxes paid by women would <br>
  cover only a very small proportion of the <br>
  establishment charges of the State which would <br>
  properly be assigned to them.&nbsp; It falls to man <br>
  to make up that deficit. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it is to be noted with respect to those <br>
  women who pay their full pro rata contribu- <br>
  tion and who ask to be treated as a class apart <br>
  from, and superior to, other women, that only <br>
  a very small proportion of these have made <br>
  their position for themselves. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immeasurably the larger number are in a <br>
  solvent position only because men have placed <br>
  them there.&nbsp; All large fortunes and practically <br>
  all the incomes which are furnished by invest- <br>
  ments are derived from man.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 46 <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nay; but the very revenues which the <br>
  Woman Suffrage Societies devote to man's <br>
  vilification are to a preponderating extent de- <br>
  rived from funds which he earned and gave <br>
  over to woman. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In connexion with the financial position of <br>
  woman as here stated, it will be well to consider <br>
  first the rich woman's claim to the vote. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may seek light on the logical and moral <br>
  aspects of this claim by considering here two <br>
  parallel cases. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The position which is occupied by the peer <br>
  under the English Constitution furnishes a <br>
  very interesting parallel to the position of the <br>
  woman who is here in question. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time out of mind the Commons have viewed <br>
  with the utmost jealousy any effort of the <br>
  House of Lords to obtain co-partnership with <br>
  them in the control of the finances of the State; <br>
  and, in pursuance of that traditional policy, <br>
  the peers have recently, after appeal to the <br>
  country, been shorn of the last vestige of <br>
  financial control.&nbsp; Now we may perhaps see,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 47 <br>
  in this jealousy of a House of Lords, which <br>
  represents inherited wealth, displayed by a <br>
  House of Commons representing voters elect- <br>
  ing on a financial qualification, an unconscious <br>
  groping after the moral principle that those <br>
  citizens who are solvent by their own efforts, <br>
  and only these, should control the finances of <br>
  the State. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And if this analogy finds acceptance, it <br>
  would not--even if there were nothing else <br>
  than this against such proposals--be logically <br>
  possible, after ousting the peers who are large <br>
  tax-payers from all control over the finances <br>
  of the State, to create a new class of voters out <br>
  of the female representatives of unearned <br>
  wealth. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second parallel case which we have to <br>
  consider presents a much simpler analogy. <br>
  Consideration will show that the position oc- <br>
  cupied in the State by the woman who has <br>
  inherited money is analogous to that occupied <br>
  in a firm by a sleeping partner who stands in <br>
  the shoes of a deceased working partner, and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 48 <br>
  who has only a small amount of capital in the <br>
  business.&nbsp; Now, if such a partner were to <br>
  claim any financial control, and were to make <br>
  trouble about paying his <i>pro rata</i> establish- <br>
  ment charges, he would be very sharply called <br>
  to order.&nbsp; And he would never dream of ap- <br>
  pealing to Justice by breaking windows, go- <br>
  ing to gaol, and undertaking a hunger strike. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coming back from the particular to the <br>
  general, and from the logical to the moral <br>
  aspect of woman's claim to control the finances <br>
  of the State on the ground that she is a tax- <br>
  payer, it will suffice to point out that this claim <br>
  is on a par with the claim to increased political <br>
  power and completer control over the finances <br>
  of the State which is put forward by a class of <br>
  male voters who are already paying much less <br>
  than their<i> pro rata</i> share of the upkeep of the <br>
  State. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In each case it is a question of trying to get <br>
  control of other people's money.&nbsp; And in the <br>
  case of woman it is of "trying on" in connexion <br>
  with her public partnership with man that prin-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 49 <br>
  ciple of domestic partnership, "All yours is <br>
  mine, and all mine's my own." <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next to the plea of justice, the plea which is <br>
  advanced most insistently by the woman who <br>
  is contending for a vote is the plea of liberty. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have here, again, a word which is a val- <br>
  uable asset to woman suffrage both in the re- <br>
  spect that it brings moral pressure to bear, and <br>
  in the respect that it is a word of ambiguous <br>
  meaning. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with this we have John Stuart <br>
  Mill making propaganda for woman suffrage <br>
  in a tractate entitled the<i> Subjection of</i> <br>
  <i>Women</i>; we have a Woman's <i>Freedom</i> League <br>
  --"freedom" being a question-begging syn- <br>
  onym for "parliamentary franchise"--and <br>
  everywhere in the literature of woman's suf- <br>
  frage we have talk of woman's "emancipa- <br>
  tion"; and we have women characterised as <br>
  serfs, or slaves--the terms <i>serfs</i> and <i>slaves</i> <br>
  supplying, of course, effective rhetorical syn- <br>
  onyms for non-voters. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we have succeeded in getting through&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 50 <br>
  these thick husks of untruth we find that the <br>
  idea of liberty which floats before the eyes of <br>
  woman is, not at all a question of freedom from <br>
  unequitable legal restraints, but essentially a <br>
  question of getting more of the personal lib- <br>
  erty (or command of other people's services), <br>
  which the possession of money confers and <br>
  more freedom from sexual restraints. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The suffragist agitator makes profit out <br>
  of this ambiguity.&nbsp; In addressing the woman <br>
  worker who does not, at the rate which her <br>
  labour commands on the market, earn enough <br>
  to give her any reasonable measure of financial <br>
  freedom, the agitator will assure her that the <br>
  suffrage would bring her more money, describ- <br>
  ing the woman suffrage cause to her as the <br>
  cause of liberty.&nbsp; By juggling in this way with <br>
  the two meanings of "liberty" she will draw <br>
  her into her toils. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The vote, however, would not raise wages <br>
  of the woman worker and bring to her the <br>
  financial, nor yet the physiological freedom <br>
  she is seeking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 51 <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tactics of the suffragist agitator are the <br>
  same when she is dealing with a woman who is <br>
  living at the charges of a husband or relative, <br>
  and who recoils against the idea that she lies <br>
  under a moral obligation to make to the man <br>
  who works for her support some return of <br>
  gratitude.&nbsp; The suffragist agitator will point <br>
  out to her that such an obligation is slavery, <br>
  and that the woman's suffrage cause is the <br>
  cause of freedom. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so we find the women who want to have <br>
  everything for nothing, and the wives who do <br>
  not see that they are beholden to man for any- <br>
  thing, and those who consider that they have <br>
  not made a sufficiently good bargain for them- <br>
  selves--in short, all the ungrateful women-- <br>
  flock to the banner of Women's Freedom-- <br>
  the banner of financial freedom for woman at <br>
  the expense of financial servitude for man. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The grateful woman will practically always <br>
  be an anti-suffragist. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be well, before passing on to another&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 52 <br>
  class of arguments, to summarise what has <br>
  been said in the three foregoing sections. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have recognised that woman has not <br>
  been defrauded of elementary natural rights; <br>
  that Justice, as distinguished from egalitarian <br>
  equity, does not prescribe that she should be <br>
  admitted to the suffrage; and that her status <br>
  is not, as is dishonestly alleged, a status of <br>
  serfdom or slavery. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this the whole case for recrimina- <br>
  tion against man, and <i>a fortiori</i> <i>[for greater reason]</i> the
case for <br>
[a] resort to violence, collapses. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And if it does collapse, this is one of those <br>
  things that carries consequences.&nbsp; It would <br>
  beseem man to bethink himself that to give in <br>
  to an unjustified and doubtfully honest claim <br>
  is to minister to the demoralisation of the <br>
  claimant.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; W<font size="-1">E</font> pass from the argument from
 elemen- <br>
  tary natural rights to a different class of argu- <br>
  ments--intellectual grievances.&nbsp; The suffra- <br>
  gist tells us that it is unchivalrous to oppose <br>
  woman's suffrage; that it is insulting to tell <br>
  woman that she is unfit to exercise the franchise; s<br>
  that it is "illogical" to make in her case <br>
  an exception to a general rule; that it is mere <br>
  "prejudice" to withhold the vote from her; <br>
  that it is indignity that the virtuous and highly <br>
  intelligent woman has no vote, while the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 54 <br>
  drunkard has; and that the woman of property <br>
  has no vote, while her male underlings have; <br>
  and, lastly, that it is an affront that a woman <br>
  should be required to obey "man-made" <br>
  laws. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may take these in their order. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us consider chivalry, first, from the <br>
  standpoint of the woman suffragist.&nbsp; Her no- <br>
  tion of <i>chivalry</i> is that man should accept <br>
  every disadvantageous offer which may be <br>
  made to him by woman. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That, of course, is to make chivalry the prin- <br>
  ciple of egalitarian equity limited in its appli- <br>
  cation to the case between man and woman. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It follows that she who holds that the suf- <br>
  frage ought, in obedience to that principle of <br>
  justice, to be granted to her by man, might <br>
  quite logically hold that everything else in <br>
  man's gift ought also to be conceded. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But to do the woman suffragist justice, she <br>
  does not press the argument from chivalry. <br>
  Inasmuch as life has brought home to her that <br>
  the ordinary man has quite other conceptions&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 55 <br>
  of that virtue, she declares that "she has no <br>
  use for it." <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us now turn to the anti-suffragist view. <br>
  The anti-suffragist (man or woman) holds that <br>
  chivalry is a principle which enters into every <br>
  reputable relation between the sexes, and that <br>
  of all the civilising agencies at work in the <br>
  world it is the most important. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I think I hear the reader interpose, <br>
  "What, then, is chivalry if it is not a question <br>
  of serving woman without reward?" <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A moment's thought will make the matter <br>
  clear. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a man makes this compact with a <br>
  woman, "I will do you reverence, and protect <br>
  you, and yield you service; and you, for your <br>
  part, will hold fast to an ideal of gentleness, of <br>
  personal refinement, of modesty, of joyous <br>
  maternity, and to who shall say what other <br>
  graces and virtues that endear woman to <br>
  man," that is <i>chivalry</i>. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not a question of a purely one-sided&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 56 <br>
  bargain, as in the suffragist conception.&nbsp; Nor <br>
  yet is it a bargain about purely material things. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a bargain in which man gives both <br>
  material things, and also things which pertain <br>
  perhaps somewhat to the spirit; and in which <br>
  woman gives back of these last. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But none the less it is of the nature of a con- <br>
  tract.&nbsp; There is in it the inexorable <i>do ut des;</i> <br>
  <i>facio ut facias [give me this, and I will give you that; do this for
me, and I will do that for you].</i> <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the contract is infringed when woman <br>
  breaks out into violence, when she jettisons <br>
  her personal refinement, when she is ungrate- <br>
  ful, and, possibly, when she places a quite ex- <br>
  travagantly high estimate upon her intellectual <br>
  powers. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We now turn from these almost too intimate <br>
  questions of personal morality to discuss the <br>
  other grievances which were enumerated above. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to the suffragist's complaint <br>
  that it is <i>"insulting"</i> for woman to be told that <br>
  she is as a class unfit to exercise the suffrage, <br>
  it is relevant to point out that one is not in-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 57 <br>
  sulted by being told about oneself, or one's <br>
  class, untruths, but only at being told about <br>
  oneself, or one's class, truths which one dis- <br>
  likes.&nbsp; And it is, of course, an offence against <br>
  ethics to try to dispose of an unpalatable gen- <br>
  eralisation by characterising it as "insulting." <br>
  But nothing that man could do would be <br>
  likely to prevent the suffragist resorting to <br>
  this aggravated form of intellectual immor- <br>
  ality. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may now turn to the complaint that it <br>
  is "illogical" to withhold the vote from women. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the kind of complaint which brings <br>
  out in relief the logical endowment and legis- <br>
  lative sagacity of the suffragist. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to her logical endowment it <br>
  will suffice to indicate that the suffragist <br>
  would appear to regard the promulgation of a <br>
  rule which is to hold without exception as an <br>
  essentially logical act; and the admission of <br>
  any class exception to a rule of general ap- <br>
  plication as an illogicality.&nbsp; It would on this <br>
  principle be "illogical" to except, under con-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 58 <br>
  scription, the female population from military <br>
  service. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to the suffragist's legislative <br>
  sagacity we may note that she asks that we <br>
  should put back the clock, and return to the <br>
  days when any arbitrary principle might be <br>
  adduced as a ground for legislation.&nbsp; It is as <br>
  if Bentham had never taught:-- <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is it to offer a <i>good reason</i> with re- <br>
  spect to a law?&nbsp; It is to allege the good or <br>
  evil which the law tends to produce; so much <br>
  good, so many arguments in its favour; so <br>
  much evil, so many arguments against it. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is it to offer a <i>false reason?</i>&nbsp; It
is  <br>
  the alleging for, or against a law, something <br>
  else than its good or evil effects." <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, we may take up the question as to <br>
  whether an unwelcome generalisation may <br>
  legitimately be got out of the way by char- <br>
  acterising it as a prejudice.&nbsp; This is a funda- <br>
  mentally important question not only in con- <br>
  nexion with such an issue as woman suffrage, <br>
  but in connexion with all search for truth in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 59 <br>
  those regions where crucial scientific experi- <br>
  ments cannot be instituted. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the whole of this region of thought we <br>
  have to guide ourselves by generalisations. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now every generalisation is in a sense a <i>pre-</i>
 <br>
  <i>judgment</i>.&nbsp; We make inferences from cases <br>
  or individuals that have already presented <br>
  themselves to such cases or individuals of the <br>
  same class as may afterwards present them- <br>
  selves.&nbsp; And if our generalisation happens to <br>
  be an unfavourable one, we shall of necessity <br>
  have prejudged the case against those who are <br>
  exceptions to their class. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, for example, the proposition that <br>
  woman is incapable of usefully exercising the <br>
  parliamentary franchise prejudges the case <br>
  against a certain number of capable women. <br>
  It would none the less be absolutely anarch- <br>
  ical to propose to abandon the system of <br>
  guiding ourselves by prejudgments; and un- <br>
  favourable prejudgments or prejudices are <br>
  logically as well justified, and are obviously&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 60 <br>
  as indispensable to us as favourable prejudg- <br>
  ments. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The suffragist who proposes to dispose of <br>
  generalisations which are unfavourable to <br>
  woman as prejudices ought therefore to be told <br>
  to stand down. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has probably never suggested itself <br>
  to her that, if there were a mind which was not <br>
  stored with both favourable prejudgments <br>
  and prejudices, it would be a mind which <br>
  had learned absolutely nothing from experi- <br>
  ence. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I hear the reader interpose, "Is there <br>
  not a grave danger that generalisations may <br>
  be erroneous?" <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I can hear the woman suffragist inter- <br>
  ject, "Is there not a grave danger that unflat- <br>
  tering generalisations about woman may be <br>
  erroneous?" <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The answer to the general question is that <br>
  there is of course always the risk that our gen- <br>
  eralisations may be erroneous.&nbsp; But when a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 61 <br>
  generalisation finds wide acceptance among <br>
  the thoughtful, we have come as close to truth <br>
  as it is possible for humanity to come. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the question put by the suffragist the <br>
  reply is that experience with regard to the <br>
  capacity of woman has been accumulating in <br>
  all climes, and through all times; and that the <br>
  belief of men in the inherent inferiority of <br>
  women in the matter of intellectual morality, <br>
  and in the power of adjudication, has never <br>
  varied. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I pass now to the two most familiar griev- <br>
  ances of the suffragist; the grievance that the <br>
  virtuous and intelligent woman has no vote, <br>
  while the male drunkard has; and the griev- <br>
  ance that the woman of property has no vote, <br>
  while her male underlings have. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All that is worth while saying on these points <br>
  is that the suffragist is here manufacturing <br>
  grievances for herself, <i>first</i>, by reasoning from <br>
  the false premiss that every legal distinction <br>
  which happens to press hardly upon a few in- <br>
  dividuals ought for that to be abrogated; and,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 62 <br>
  <i>secondly</i>, by steady leaving out of sight that <br>
  logical inconsistencies can, for the more part, <br>
  be got rid of only at the price of bringing others <br>
  into being. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man who looks forward to the intel- <br>
  lectual development of woman must be <br>
  brought near to despair when he perceives that <br>
  practically every woman suffragist sees in <br>
  every hard case arising in connexion with a <br>
  legal distinction affecting woman, an insult <br>
  and example of the iniquity of man-made <br>
  laws, or a logical inconsistency which could <br>
  with a very little good-will be removed. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have come now to the last item on our <br>
  list, to the grievance that woman has to submit <br>
  herself to "<i>man-made laws</i>." <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a grievance which well rewards study. <br>
  It is worth study from the suffragist point of <br>
  view, because it is the one great injury under <br>
  which all others are subsumed.&nbsp; And it is <br>
  worth studying from the anti-suffragist point <br>
  of view, because it shows how little the suf- <br>
  fragist understands of the terms she employs;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 63 <br>
  and how unreal are the wrongs which she re- <br>
  sents. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quite marvelously has the woman suffra- <br>
  gist in this connexion misapprehended; or <br>
  would she have us say misrepresented? <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman suffragist misapprehends--it <br>
  will be better to assume that she "misappre- <br>
  hends"--when she suggests that we, the male <br>
  electors, have framed the laws. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In reality the law which we live under--and <br>
  the law in those States which have adopted <br>
  either the English, or the Roman law-- <br>
  descends from the past.&nbsp; It has been evolved <br>
  precedent, by precedent, by the decisions of <br>
  generation upon generation of judges, and it <br>
  has for centuries been purged by amending <br>
  statutes.&nbsp; Moreover we, the present male elec- <br>
  tors--the electors who are savagely attacked <br>
  by the suffragist for our asserted iniquities in <br>
  connexion with the laws which regulate sexual <br>
  relations--have never in our capacity as elec- <br>
  tors had any power to alter an old, or to sug- <br>
  gest a new law; except only in so far as by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 64 <br>
  voting Conservative or Liberal we may indi- <br>
  rectly have remotely influenced the general <br>
  trend of legislation. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well but"--the suffragist will here rejoin <br>
  --"is it not at any rate true that in the draft- <br>
  ing of statutes and the framing of judicial <br>
  decisions man has always nefariously discrim- <br>
  inated against woman?" <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question really supplies its own answer. <br>
  It will be obvious to every one who considers <br>
  that the drafting of statutes and the formula- <br>
  ting of legal decisions is almost as impersonal a <br>
  procedure as that of drawing up the rules to <br>
  govern a game; and it offers hardly more op- <br>
  portunity for discriminating between man and <br>
  woman. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are, however, three questions in con- <br>
  nexion with which the law can and does make <br>
  a distinction between man and woman. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>first</i> is that of sexual relations: rape,
<br>
  divorce, bastardy, and the age of consent.&nbsp; In <br>
  connexion with <i>rape</i>, it has never been alleged <br>
  that the law is not sufficiently severe.&nbsp; It is, or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 65 <br>
  has been, under colonial conditions, severe up <br>
  to the point of ferocity.&nbsp; In the matter of <br>
  <i>divorce</i> the law of a minority of man-governed <br>
  States differentiates in favour of man.&nbsp; It <br>
  does so influenced by tradition, by what are <br>
  held to be the natural equities, and by the fact <br>
  that a man is required to support his wife's <br>
  progeny.&nbsp; The law of <i>bastardy</i> <i>[illegitimate childbirth]</i>
   is what it is <br>
  because of the dangers of blackmail.&nbsp; The law <br>
  which fixes the age of consent discriminates <br>
  against man, laying him open to a criminal <br>
  charge in situations where woman--and it is <br>
  not certain that she is not a more frequent of- <br>
  fender--escapes scot-free. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>second</i> point in which the law differ- <br>
  entiates is in the matter of exacting personal <br>
  service for the State.&nbsp; If it had not been that <br>
  man is more prone to discriminate in favour of <br>
  woman than against her, every military State, <br>
  when exacting personal military service from <br>
  men, would have demanded from women some <br>
  such equivalent personal service as would be <br>
  represented by a similar period of work in an&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 66 <br>
  army clothing establishment, or ordnance fac- <br>
  tory, or army laundry; or would at any rate <br>
  have levied upon woman a ransom in lieu of <br>
  such service. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>third</i> point in which the law dis- <br>
  tinguishes between man and woman is with ref- <br>
  erence to the suffrage.&nbsp; The object of this <br>
  book is to show that this is equitable and in the <br>
  interests of both. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The suffragist further misapprehends when <br>
  she regards it as an indignity to obey laws <br>
  which she has not herself framed, or specifically <br>
  sanctioned.&nbsp; (The whole male electorate, be <br>
  it remarked, would here lie under the same <br>
  dignity as woman.) <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in reality, whether it is a question of the <br>
  rules of a game, or of the reciprocal rights and <br>
  duties of members of a community, it is, and <br>
  ought to be, to every reasonable human being <br>
  not a grievance, but a matter of felicitation, <br>
  that an expert or a body of experts should have <br>
  evolved a set of rules under which order and <br>
  harmony are achieved.&nbsp; Only vanity and folly&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 67 <br>
  would counsel amateurs to try to draw up rules <br>
  or laws for themselves. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, the woman suffragist takes it as a <br>
  matter of course that she would herself be <br>
  able to construct a system of workable laws. <br>
  In point of fact, the framing of a really useful <br>
  law is a question of divining something which <br>
  will apply to an infinite number of different <br>
  cases and individuals.&nbsp; It is an intellectual <br>
  feat on a par with the framing of a great <br>
  generalisation.&nbsp; And would woman--that be- <br>
  ing of such short sight, whose mind is always <br>
  so taken up with whatever instances lie near- <br>
  est to her--be capable of framing anything <br>
  that could pass muster as a great generalisa- <br>
  ition? <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, the suffragist fails to see that the <br>
  function of framing the laws is not an essential <br>
  function of citizenship. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The essential functions of citizenship are the <br>
  shaping of public policy, and the control of <br>
  the administrative Acts of Government. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such directive control is in a state of political&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 68 <br>
  freedom exercised through two quite different <br>
  agencies. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is exercised--and it is of the very essence <br>
  of political freedom that this should be the <br>
  normal method of control--in the first place, <br>
  through expressed public opinion.&nbsp; By this <br>
  are continuously regulated not only momen- <br>
  tous matters of State, such as declarations of <br>
  war and the introduction of constitutional <br>
  changes, but also smaller and more individual <br>
  matters, such as the commutation of a capital <br>
  sentence, or the forcible feeding of militant suf- <br>
  fragists. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the background, behind the moral com- <br>
  pulsion of expressed public opinion, there is, <br>
  in the case of a Parliamentary State, also an- <br>
  other instrument of control.&nbsp; I have in view <br>
  that periodical settlement of the contested <br>
  rulership of the State by the force of a majority <br>
  of electors which is denoted a general elec- <br>
  tion. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The control exercised by the suffrages of <br>
  the electors in a general election is in certain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 69 <br>
  important respects less effective than that ex- <br>
  ercised by the everyday public expression of <br>
  opinion.&nbsp; It falls short in the respect that its <br>
  verdicts are, except only in connexion with the <br>
  issue as to whether the Government is to be <br>
  retained in office or dismissed, ambiguous ver- <br>
  dicts; further, in the respect that it comes into <br>
  application either before governmental pro- <br>
  posals have taken definite shape, or only after <br>
  the expiration of a term of years, when the <br>
  events are already passing out of memory. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we now consider the question of woman's <br>
  franchise from the wider point of view here <br>
  opened up, it will be clear that, so far as con- <br>
  cerns the control which is exercised through <br>
  public opinion on the Government, the intelli- <br>
  gent woman, and especially the intelligent <br>
  woman who has made herself an expert on any <br>
  matter, is already in possession of that which is <br>
  a greater power than the franchise.&nbsp; She has <br>
  the power which attaches to all intelligent opin- <br>
  ion promulgated in a free State.&nbsp; Moreover, <br>
  wherever the special interest of women are in-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 70 <br>
  volved, any woman may count on being lis- <br>
  tened to if she is voicing the opinions of any <br>
  considerable section of her sex. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In reality, therefore, woman is disfran- <br>
  chised only so far as relates to the confirmation <br>
  of a Government in office, or its dismissal by <br>
  the <i>ultima ratio</i> <i>[ultimate reason]</i> of an electoral contest.&nbsp;
 And <br>
  when we reflect that woman does not come into <br>
  consideration as a compelling force, and that <br>
  an electoral contest partakes of the nature of <br>
  a civil war, it becomes clear that to give her the <br>
  parliamentary vote would be to reduce all those <br>
  trials of strength which take the form of elec- <br>
  toral contests to the level of a farce. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this I have, I will not say completed <br>
  the tale of the suffragist's grievances--that <br>
  would be impossible--but I have at any rate <br>
  dealt with those which she has most acrimoni- <br>
  ously insisted upon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T<font size="-1">HERE</font>, however, remains still
 a further class <br>
  of arguments.&nbsp; I have in view here arguments <br>
  which have nothing to do with elementary <br>
  natural rights, nor yet with wounded <i>amour</i> <br>
  <i>propre.</i>&nbsp; They concern ethics, and sympathy, <br>
  and charitable feelings. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The suffragist here gives to man "counsels <br>
  of perfection." <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be enough to consider here two of <br>
  these:--the <i>first</i>, the argument that woman, <br>
  being the weaker vessel, needs, more than man, <br>
  the suffrage for her <i>protection</i>; the <i>second</i>,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 72 <br>
  that woman, being less than man in relation <br>
  to public life, ought to be given the vote for <br>
  <i>instructional purposes</i>. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first of these appeals will, for instance, <br>
  take the following form:--"Consider the poor <br>
  sweated East End woman worker.&nbsp; She <br>
  knows best where the shoe pinches. You men <br>
  can't know.&nbsp; Give her a vote; and you shall see <br>
  that she will very soon better her condition." <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I hear that argument I consider:-- <br>
  We will suppose that woman was ill.&nbsp; Should <br>
  we go to her and say: "You know best, know <br>
  better than any man, what is wrong with you. <br>
  Here are all the medicines and remedies. <br>
  Make your own selection, for that will assur- <br>
  edly provide what will be the most likely to <br>
  help." <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If this would be both futile and inhuman, <br>
  much more would it be so to seek out this <br>
  woman who is sick in fortune and say to her, <br>
  "Go and vote for the parliamentary candidate <br>
  who will be likely to influence the trend of <br>
  legislation in a direction which will help."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 73 <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What would really help the sweated woman <br>
  labourer would, of course, be to have the best <br>
  intellect brought to bear, not specially upon <br>
  the problem of indigent woman, but upon the <br>
  whole social problem. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the aspect of the question which is, from <br>
  our present point of view, the fundamentally <br>
  important one is the following: Granting that <br>
  the extension of the suffrage to woman would <br>
  enable her, as the suffragist contends, to bring <br>
  pressure upon her parliamentary representa- <br>
  tive, man, while anxious to do his very best <br>
  for woman, might very reasonably refuse to <br>
  go about it in this particular way. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a man has a wife whom he desires to treat <br>
  indulgently, he does not necessarily open a <br>
  joint account with her at his bankers. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If he wants to contribute to a charity he <br>
  does not give to the managers of that charity <br>
  a power of attorney over his property. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And if he is a philanthropical director of a <br>
  great business he does not, when a pathetic <br>
  case of poverty among his staff is brought&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 74 <br>
  to his notice, imperil the fortunes of his under- <br>
  taking by giving to his workmen shares and a <br>
  vote in the management. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, he would perhaps regard it as a <br>
  little suspect if a group of those who were <br>
  claiming this as a right came and told him that <br>
  "it was very <i>selfish</i> of him" not to grant their <br>
  request. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Precious above rubies to the suffragist and <br>
  every other woman who wants to apply the <br>
  screw to man is that word <i>selfish</i>.&nbsp; It furnishes <br>
  her with the <i>petitio principii</i> that man is under <br>
  an ethical obligation to give anything she <br>
  chooses to ask. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We come next--and this is the last of all <br>
  the arguments we have to consider--to the <br>
  argument that the suffrage ought to be given <br>
  to woman for instructional purposes. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it would be futile to attempt to deny <br>

  there be able to make any experiment she <br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But one wonders why it has not been pro- <br>
  posed to carry woman's instruction further, <br>
  and for instructional purposes to make of a <br>
  woman let us say a judge, or an ambassador, <br>
  or a Prime Minister. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There would--if only it were legitimate to <br>
  sacrifice vital national interests--be not a <br>
  little to say in favour of such a course.&nbsp; One <br>
  might at any rate hope by these means once <br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T<font size="-1">HE</font> woman suffrage movement has
now <br>
  gone too far to be disposed of by the over- <br>
  throw of its arguments, and by a mere indica- <br>
  tion of those which could be advanced on the <br>
  other side.&nbsp; The situation demands the bring- <br>
  ing forward of the case against woman's suf- <br>
  frage; and it must be the full and quite unex- <br>
  purgated case. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shall endeavour to do this in the fewest pos- <br>
  sible words, and to be more especially brief <br>
  where I have to pass again over ground which <br>
  I have previously traversed in dealing with the <br>
  arguments of the suffragists. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I may begin with what is fundamental.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  It is an axiom that we should in legislating <br>
  guide ourselves directly by considerations of <br>
  utility and expediency.&nbsp; For abstract princi- <br>
  ples--I have in view here <i>rights, justice, egali-</i> <br>
  <i>tarian equity, equality, liberty, chivalry, logi-</i> <br>
  <i>cality,</i> and such like--are not all of them <br>
  guides to utility; and each of these is, as we <br>
  have seen, open to all manner of private mis- <br>
  interpretation. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Applying the above axiom to the issue be- <br>
  fore us, it is clear that we ought to confine <br>
  ourselves here to the discussion of the ques- <br>
  tion as to whether the State would, or would <br>
  not, suffer from the admission of women to <br>
  the electorate. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can arrive at a judgment upon this by <br>
  considering, on the one hand, the class-char- <br>
  acters of women so far as these may be rele- <br>
  vant to the question of the suffrage; and, on <br>
  the other hand, the legislative programmes <br>
  put forward by the female legislative re- <br>
  former and the feminist. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In connexion with the class-characters of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  woman, it will be well, before attempting to <br>
  indicate them, to interpolate here the general <br>
  consideration that the practical statesman, <br>
  who has to deal with things as they are, is not <br>
  required to decide whether the characters of <br>
  women which will here be considered are, as <br>
  the physiologist (who knows that the sexual <br>
  products influence every tissue of the body) <br>
  cannot doubt, "secondary sexual characters"; <br>
  or, as the suffragist contends, "acquired char- <br>
  acters."&nbsp; It will be plain that whether defects <br>
  are "secondary sexual characters" (and there- <br>
  fore as irremediable as "racial characters"); or <br>
  whether they are "acquired characters" (and <br>
  as such theoretically remediable) they are <br>
  relevant to the question of the concession of <br>
  the suffrage just so long as they continue to <br>
  be exhibited.<sup><font size="-2">1</font></sup> </p>

<p><sup><font size="-2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1</font></sup><font size="-1">
   This is a question on which Mill (vide <i>Subjection of Women</i> ,</font>
   <br>
  <font size="-1">last third of Chapter I) has endeavoured to confuse the
issues</font>  <br>
  <font size="-1">for his reader, first, by representing that by no possibility
 can</font> <br>
  <font size="-1">man know anything of the "nature,"<i> i.e.</i> , of the
"secondary</font>  <br>
  <font size="-1">sexual characters" of woman; and, secondly, by distracting
 at-</font> <br>
  <font size="-1">tention from the fact that "acquired characters" may produce</font>
   <br>
  <font size="-1">unfitness for the suffrage.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 81 <br>
  &nbsp; </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The primordial argument against giving <br>
  woman the vote is that that vote would not <br>
  represent physical force. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it is by physical force alone and by <br>
  prestige--which represents physical force in <br>
  the background--that a nation protects itself <br>
  against foreign interference, upholds its rule <br>
  over subject populations, and enforces its own <br>
  laws.&nbsp; And nothing could in the end more cer- <br>
  tainly lead to war and revolt than the decline <br>
  of the military spirit and loss of prestige which <br>
  would inevitably follow if man admitted <br>
  woman into political co-partnership. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While it is arguable that such a partnership <br>
  with woman in government as obtains in Aus- <br>
  tralia and New Zealand is sufficiently unreal <br>
  to be endurable, there cannot be two opinions <br>
  on the question that a virile and imperial race <br>
  will not brook any attempt at forcible control <br>
  by women. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, no military foreign nation or native <br>
  race would ever believe in the stamina and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 82 <br>
  firmness of purpose of any nation that submit- <br>
  ted even to the semblance of such control. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The internal equilibrium of the State also <br>
  would be endangered by the admission to the <br>
  register of millions of electors whose vote would <br>
  not be endorsed by the authority of physical <br>
  force. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regarded&nbsp; from this point of view a <br>
  Woman's Suffrage measure stands on an ab- <br>
  solutely different basis to any other extension <br>
  of the suffrage.&nbsp; An extension which takes in <br>
  more men--whatever else it may do--makes <br>
  for stability in the respect that it makes the <br>
  decrees of the legislature more irresistible. <br>
  An extension which takes in any women <br>
  undermines the physical sanction of the <br>
  laws. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can see indications of the evil that would <br>
  follow such an event in the profound dissatis- <br>
  faction which is felt when--in violation of the <br>
  democratic principle that every man shall <br>
  count for one, and no man for more than one&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 83 <br>
  --the political wishes of the large constituen- <br>
  cies which return relatively few members to <br>
  Parliament, are overborne by those of con- <br>
  stituencies which, with a smaller aggregate <br>
  population, return more members. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And we see what such evil finally culminates <br>
  in when the over-representation of one part of <br>
  a country and the corresponding under-rep- <br>
  resentation of other portions has led a large <br>
  section of the people to pledge themselves to <br>
  disregard the eventual ordinances of Parlia- <br>
  ment. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If ever the question as to whether the will <br>
  of Ulster or that of the Nationalists is to pre- <br>
  vail is brought to the arbitrament of physical <br>
  force, it will be due to the inequalities of parlia- <br>
  mentary representation as between England <br>
  and Ireland, and as between the Unionist and <br>
  Nationalist population of Ulster. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The general lesson that all governmental <br>
  action ought to be backed by force, is fur- <br>
  ther brought home to the conscience when we <br>
  take note of the fact that every one feels that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 84 <br>
  public morality is affronted when senile, in- <br>
  firm, and bedridden men are brought to the <br>
  poll to turn the scale in hotly contested elec- <br>
  tions. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For electoral decisions are felt to have moral <br>
  prestige only when the electoral figures quan- <br>
  titatively represent the physical forces which <br>
  are engaged on either side.&nbsp; And where vital <br>
  interests are involved, no class of men can be <br>
  expected to accept any decision other than one <br>
  which rests upon the <i>ultima ratio</i>. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now all the evils which are the outcome of <br>
  disparities between the parliamentary power <br>
  and the organised physical force of contend- <br>
  ing parties would "grow" a hundredfold if <br>
  women were admitted to the suffrage. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There would after that be no electoral or <br>
  parliamentary decision which would not be <br>
  open to challenge on the ground that it was <br>
  impossible to tell whether the party which <br>
  came out the winner had a majority which <br>
  could enforce its will, or only a majority ob- <br>
  tained by the inclusion of women.&nbsp; And no&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 85 <br>
  measure of redistribution could ever set that <br>
  right. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There may find place here also the considera- <br>
  tion that the voting of women would be an un- <br>
  settling element in the government of the <br>
  State, forasmuch as they would, by reason of a <br>
  general lack of interest in public affairs, only <br>
  very; seldom come to the poll: would, in fact, <br>
  come to the poll in full strength only when <br>
  some special appeal had come home to their <br>
  emotions. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now an electorate which includes a very <br>
  large proportion of quite uninterested voters <br>
  would be in the same case as a legislature <br>
  which included a very large proportion of <br>
  members who made a practice of staying away. <br>
  It would be in the same case, because the ab- <br>
  sentees, who would not have acquired the train- <br>
  ing which comes from consecutive attention <br>
  to public affairs, might at any moment step <br>
  in and upset the stability of State by voting <br>
  for some quite unconsidered measure. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coming back in conclusion to our main is-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 86 <br>
  sue, I would re-emphasise an aspect of the <br>
  question upon which I have already elsewhere <br>
  insisted.<sup><font size="-2">1</font></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have in view
the fact that woman <br>
  does, and should, stand to physical violence in <br>
  a fundamentally different relation to man. <br>
  Nothing can alter the fact that, the very mo- <br>
  ment woman resorts to violence, she places <br>
  herself within the jurisdiction of an ethical <br>
  law, which is as old as civilisation, and which <br>
  was framed in its interests. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T<font size="-1">HE</font> woman voter would be pernicious
 to <br>
  the State not only because she could not back <br>
  her vote by physical force, but also by reason <br>
  of her intellectual defects. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Woman's mind attends in appraising a state- <br>
  ment primarily to the mental images which it <br>
  evokes, and only secondarily--and sometimes <br>
  not at all--to what is predicated in the state- <br>
  ment.&nbsp; It is over-influenced by individual in- <br>
  stances; arrives at conclusions on incomplete <br>
  evidence; has a very imperfect sense of pro- <br>
  portion; accepts the congenial as true, and re- <br>
  jects the uncongenial as false; takes the imagi-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 88 <br>
  nary which is desired for reality, and treats the <br>
  undesired reality which is out of sight as non- <br>
  existent---building up for itself in this way, <br>
  when biased by predilections and aversions, a <br>
  very unreal picture of the external world. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The explanation of this is to be found in all <br>
  the physiological attachments of woman's <br>
  mind:<sup><font size="-1"> </font><font size="-2">1</font></sup> in the
fact that mental images are in <br>
  her over-intimately linked up with emotional <br>
  reflex responses; that yielding to such reflex <br>
  responses gives gratification; that intellec- <br>
  tual analysis and suspense of judgment involve <br>
  an inhibition of reflex responses which is felt as <br>
  neural distress; that precipitate judgment <br>
  brings relief from this physiological strain; <br>
  and that woman looks upon her mind not as an <br>
  implement for the pursuit of truth, but as an <br>
  instrument for providing her with creature <br>
  comforts in the form of agreeable mental im- <br>
  ages. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to satisfy the physical yearning </p>

<p>&nbsp;<font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><sup><font size="-2">1</font></sup><font size="-1">
   Certain of these have already been referred to in the letter</font> <br>

  ).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font size="+0">

  &nbsp; </p>

<p>for such comforts, a considerable section <br>
  of intelligent and virtuous women insist <br>
  on picturing to themselves that the reign of <br>
  physical force is over, or as good as over; that <br>
  distinctions based upon physical and intellec- <br>
  tual force may be reckoned as non-existent; <br>
  that male supremacy as resting upon these is a <br>
  thing of the past; and that Justice means <br>
  Egalitarian&nbsp; Equity--means&nbsp; equating the <br>
  weaklings with the strong and the incapable <br>
  with the capable. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All this because these particular ideas are <br>
  congenial to the woman of refinement, and be- <br>
  cause it is to her, when she is a suffragist, un- <br>
  congenial that there should exist another prin- <br>
  ciple of justice which demands from the phys- <br>
  ically and intellectually capable that they shall <br>
  retain the reins of government in their own <br>
  hands; and specially uncongenial that in all <br>
  man-governed States the ideas of justice of <br>
  the more forceful should have worked out so <br>
  much to the advantage of women, that a <br>
  large majority of these are indifferent or ac-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 90 <br>
  tively hostile to the Woman's Suffrage Move- <br>
  ment. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In further illustration of what has been said <br>
  above, it may be pointed out that woman, even <br>
  intelligent woman, nurses all sorts of miscon- <br>
  ceptions about herself.&nbsp; She, for instance, is <br>
  constantly picturing to herself that she can <br>
  as a worker lay claim to the same all-round <br>
  efficiency as a man--forgetting that woman <br>
  is notoriously unadapted to tasks in which se- <br>
  vere physical hardships have to be con- <br>
  fronted; and that hardly any one would, if <br>
  other alternative offered, employ a woman <br>
  in any work which imposed upon her a com- <br>
  bined physical and mental strain, or in any <br>
  work where emergencies might have to be <br>
  faced. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In like manner the suffragist is fond of <br>
  picturing to herself that woman is for all <br>
  ordinary purposes the intellectual equal, and <br>
  that the intelligent woman is the superior of <br>
  the ordinary man. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These results are arrived at by fixing the at-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 91 <br>
  tention upon the fact that an ordinary man <br>
  and an ordinary woman are, from the point of <br>
  view of memory and apprehension, very much <br>
  on a level; and that a highly intelligent woman <br>
  has a quicker memory and a more rapid power <br>
  of apprehension than the ordinary man; and <br>
  further, by leaving out of regard that it is not <br>
  so much a quick memory or a rapid power of <br>
  apprehension which is required for effective <br>
  intellectual work, as originality, or at any rate <br>
  independence of thought, a faculty of fel- <br>
  icitious generalisations and diacritical judg- <br>
  ment, long-sustained intellectual effort, an un- <br>
  selective mirroring of the world in the mind, <br>
  and that relative immunity to fallacy which <br>
  goes together with a stable and comparatively <br>
  unresponsive nervous system. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we consider that the intellect of the <br>
  quite ungifted man works with this last- <br>
  mentioned physiological advantage, we can <br>
  see that the male intellect must be, and-- <br>
 <i> pace [with the permission of]</i> the woman suffragist---it in point
of fact <br>
  is, within its range, a better instrument for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 92 <br>
  dealing with the practical affairs of life than <br>
  that of the intelligent woman. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How far off we are in the case of woman <br>
  from an unselective mirroring of the world in <br>
  the mind is shown by the fact that large and <br>
  important factors of life may be represented <br>
  in woman's mind by lacun&aelig; [gaps] of which she is <br>
  totally unconscious. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, for instance, that not very unusual <br>
  type of spinster who is in a condition of re- <br>
  tarded development (and you will find this <br>
  kind of woman even on County Council's), is <br>
  completely unconscious of the sexual element <br>
  in herself and in human nature generally. <br>
  Nay, though one went from the dead, he could <br>
  not bring it home to her that unsatisfied sex- <br>
  uality is an intellectual disability. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sufficient illustration will now have been <br>
  given of woman's incapacity to take a com- <br>
  plete or objective view of any matter in which <br>
  she has a personal, or any kind of emotional <br>
  interest; and this would now be the place to <br>
  discuss those other aspects of her mind which&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 93 <br>
  are relevant to her claim to the suffrage.&nbsp; I <br>
  refer to her logical endowment and her political <br>
  sagacity. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All that I might have been required to say <br>
  here on these issues has, however, already been <br>
  said by me in dealing with the arguments of <br>
  the suffragist.&nbsp; I have there carefully writ- <br>
  ten it in between the lines. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing only remains over.--We must, <br>
  before we pass on, consider whether woman <br>
  has really, as she tells us, given earnest for the <br>
  future weeding out of these her secondary sex- <br>
  ual characters, by making quite phenomenal <br>
  advances within the lifetime of the present gen- <br>
  eration; and, above all, whether there is any <br>
  basis for woman's confident assurance that, <br>
  when for a few generations she shall have en- <br>
  joyed educational advantages, she will at any <br>
  rate pull up level with man. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The vision of the future may first engage <br>
  our attention; for only this roseate prospect <br>
  makes of any man a feminist. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the basis that all this hope rests upon&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 94 <br>
  is the belief that it is a law of heredity that ac- <br>
  quired characteristics are handed down; and, <br>
  let it be observed, that whereas this theory <br>
  found, not many decades ago, under the in- <br>
  fluence of Darwin, thousands of adherents <br>
  among scientific men, it finds to-day only here <br>
  and there an adherent. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But let that pass, for we have to consider <br>
  here, not only whether acquired characteristics <br>
  are handed down, but further whether, "if we <br>
  held that doctrine true," it would furnish scien- <br>
  tific basis for the belief that educational ad- <br>
  vantages carried on from generation to gen- <br>
  eration would level up woman's intellect to <br>
  man's; and whether, as the suffragist also be- <br>
  lieves, the narrow education of past genera- <br>
  tions of women can be held responsible for their <br>
  present intellectual shortcomings. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A moment's consideration will show--for <br>
  we may here fix our eyes only on the future--- <br>
  that woman could not hope to advance rela- <br>
  tively to man except upon the condition that <br>
  the acquired characteristics of woman, instead&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 95 <br>
  of being handed down equally to her male and <br>
  female descendants, were accumulated upon <br>
  her daughters. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now if that be a law of heredity, it is a law <br>
  which is as yet unheard of outside the sphere <br>
  of the woman suffrage societies.&nbsp; Moreover, <br>
  one is accustomed to hear women, when they <br>
  are not arguing on the suffrage, allege that <br>
  clever mothers make clever sons. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It must, as it will have come home to us, be <br>
  clear to every thoughtful mind that woman's <br>
  belief that she will, through education and the <br>
  cumulation of its effects upon her through <br>
  generations, become a more glorious being, <br>
  rests, not upon any rational basis, but only on <br>
  the physiological fact that what is congenial <br>
  to woman impresses itself upon her as true. <br>
  All that sober science in the form of history <br>
  and physiology would seem to entitle us to <br>
  hope from the future of woman is that she will <br>
  develop <i>pari passu</i> <i>[step by step]</i> with man; and that educa-
 <br>
  tion will teach her not to retard him overmuch <br>
  by her lagging in the rear.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 96 <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of this larger issue, the question as <br>
  to whether woman has, in any real sense of the <br>
  word, been making progress in the course of <br>
  the present generation, loses much of interest. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If to move about more freely, to read more <br>
  freely, to speak out her mind more freely, and <br>
  to have emancipated herself from traditionary <br>
  beliefs--and, I would add, traditionary ethics <br>
  --is to have advanced, woman has indubitably <br>
  advanced. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the educated native too has advanced <br>
  in all these respects; and he also tells us that <br>
  he is pulling up level with the white man. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us at any rate, when the suffragist <br>
  is congratulating herself on her own progress, <br>
  meditate also upon that dictum of Nietzsche, <br>
  "Progress is writ large on all woman's ban- <br>
  ners and bannerets; but one can actually see <br>
  her going back."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Y<font size="-1">ET</font> a third point has to come
 into considera- <br>
  tion in connexion with the woman voter.&nbsp; This <br>
  is, that she would be pernicious to the State <br>
  also by virtue of her defective moral equip- <br>
  ment. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me make clear what is the nature of the <br>
  defect of morality which is here imputed to <br>
  woman. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conduct may be appraised by very differ- <br>
  ent standards. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may appraise it by reference to a trans- <br>
  cendental religious ideal which demands that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 98 <br>
  the physical shall be subordinated to the spirit- <br>
  ual, and that the fetters of self should be flung <br>
  aside. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or again, we may bring into application <br>
  purely mundane utilitarian standards, and <br>
  may account conduct as immoral or moral ac- <br>
  cording as it seeks only the happiness of the <br>
  agent, or the happiness of the narrow circle <br>
  of humanity which includes along with him <br>
  also his relatives and intimate friends, or again, <br>
  the welfare of the wider circle which includes <br>
  all those with whom he may have come into con- <br>
  tact, or whom he may affect through his work; <br>
  or again, the welfare of the whole body-politic <br>
  of which we are members; or lastly, that of the <br>
  general body of mankind. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it might be contended that all these dif- <br>
  ferent moralities are in their essence one and <br>
  the same; and that one cannot comply with the <br>
  requirements of any one of these systems of <br>
  morality without fulfilling in a measure the re- <br>
  quirements of all the other moralities. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It might, for example, be urged that if a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 99 <br>
  man strive after the achievement of a trans- <br>
  cendental ideal in which self shall be annulled, <br>
  he will <i>pro tanto</i> <i>[to such extent]</i> be bringing welfare to
his do- <br>
  mestic circle; or again, that it would be im- <br>
  possible to promote domestic welfare without, <br>
  through this, promoting the welfare of the <br>
  nation, and through that the general welfare <br>
  of the world. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In like manner it might be argued that all <br>
  work done for abstract principles of morality <br>
  like liberty and justice, for the advancement <br>
  of knowledge, and for whatever else goes to <br>
  the building up of a higher civilisation, will, <br>
  by promoting the welfare of the general body <br>
  of mankind, redound to the advantage of each <br>
  several nation, and ultimately to the advantage <br>
  of each domestic circle. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But all this would be true only in a very <br>
  superficial and strictly qualified sense.&nbsp; In re- <br>
  ality, just as there is eternal conflict between <br>
  egoism and altruism, so there is conflict be- <br>
  tween the different moralities. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To take examples, the attempt to actualise&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 100 <br>
  the transcendental religious ideal may, when <br>
  pursued with ardour, very easily conflict with <br>
  the morality which makes domestic felicity its <br>
  end.&nbsp; And again--as we see in the anti-mili- <br>
  tarist movement in France, in the history of <br>
  the early Christian Church, in the case of the <br>
  Quakers and in the teachings of Tolstoy--it <br>
  may quite well set itself in conflict with na- <br>
  tional ideals, and dictate a line of conduct <br>
  which is, from the point of view of the State, <br>
  immoral. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need no further witness of the divorce <br>
  between idealistic and national morality than <br>
  that which is supplied in the memorable utter- <br>
  ance of Bishop Magee, "No state which was <br>
  conducted on truly Christian principles could <br>
  hold together for a week." <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And domestic morality will constantly come <br>
  into conflict with public morality. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To do everything in one's power to advance <br>
  one's relatives and friends irrespectively of all <br>
  considerations of merit would, no doubt, be <br>
  quite sound domestic morality; it could, how-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 101 <br>
  ever, not always be reconciled with public <br>
  morality.&nbsp; In the same way, to take one's <br>
  country's part in all eventualities would be <br>
  patriotic, but it might quite well conflict with <br>
  the higher interests of humanity. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, the point towards which we have been <br>
  winning our way is that each man's moral sta- <br>
  tion and degree will be determined by the elec- <br>
  tion which he makes where egoism and altru- <br>
  ism, and where a narrower and a wider code <br>
  of morality, conflict. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That the moral law forbids yielding to the <br>
  promptings of egoism or to those of the nar- <br>
  rower moralities when this involves a violation <br>
  of the precepts of the wider morality is axio- <br>
  matic.&nbsp; Criminal and anti-social actions are <br>
  not excused by the fact that motives which im- <br>
  pelled their commission were not purely ego- <br>
  istic. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the ethical law demands more than ab- <br>
  stention from definitely anti-social actions. <br>
  It demands from every individual that he <br>
  shall recognise the precepts of public mor-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 102 <br>
  ality as of superior obligation to those of ego- <br>
  ism and domestic morality. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the fact that her public men recognised <br>
  this ethical law Rome won for herself in the <br>
  ancient world spectacular grandeur.&nbsp; By an <br>
  unexampled national obedience to it glory has <br>
  in our time accrued to Japan.&nbsp; And, in truth, <br>
  there is not anywhere any honour or renown <br>
  but such as comes from casting away the bonds <br>
  of self and of the narrower moralities to <br>
  carry out the behests of the wider morality. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in the strongholds of transcendental <br>
  religion where it was axiomatic that mor- <br>
  ality began and was summed up in personal <br>
  morality, it is gradually coming to be rec- <br>
  ognised that, where we have two competing <br>
  moralities, it is always the wider morality <br>
  which has the prior claim upon our allegiance. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kingsley's protest against the morality of <br>
  "saving one's dirty soul" marked a step in ad- <br>
  vance.&nbsp; And we find full recognition of the <br>
  superior claim of the larger morality in that <br>
  other virile dictum of Bishop Magee, "I would&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 103 <br>
  rather have England free, than England <br>
  sober."&nbsp; That is, "I would maintain the con- <br>
  ditions which make for the highest civilisation <br>
  even at the price of a certain number of lapses <br>
  in personal and domestic morality." <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is here new, let it be noted, is only <br>
  the acknowledgment by those whose official <br>
  allegiance is to a transcendental ideal of per- <br>
  sonal morality that they are called upon to <br>
  obey a higher allegiance.&nbsp; For there has al- <br>
  ways existed, in the doctrine that guilty man <br>
  could not be pardoned and taken back into <br>
  favour until the claims of eternal justice had <br>
  been satisfied, theoretical recognition of the <br>
  principle that one must conform to the pre- <br>
  cepts of abstract morality before one may <br>
  ethically indulge oneself in the lower moral- <br>
  ities of philanthropy and personal benevo- <br>
  lence. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The view point from which I would pro- <br>
  pose to survey the morality of woman has now <br>
  been reached.&nbsp; It has, however, still to be <br>
  pointed out that we may appropriately, in com-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 104 <br>
  paring the morals of man and woman, confine <br>
  our survey to a comparatively narrow field. <br>
  That is to say, we may here rule out all that <br>
  relates to purely personal and domestic mor- <br>
  ality--for this is not relevant to the suffrage. <br>
  And we may also rule out all that relates to <br>
  offences against the police laws--such as public <br>
  drunkenness and offences against the criminal <br>
  law--for these would come into consideration <br>
  only in connexion with an absolutely inappre- <br>
  ciable fraction of voters. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be well to begin by signalising certain <br>
  points in the moral psychology of man. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When morality takes up its abode in a <br>
  man who belongs to the intellectual caste it <br>
  will show itself in his becoming mindful of his <br>
  public obligations.&nbsp; He will consider the qual- <br>
  ity of his work as affecting the interest of those <br>
  who have to place dependence upon it; be- <br>
  haviour to those who are casually brought into <br>
  relations with him; the discharge of his in- <br>
  debtedness to the community; and the proper <br>
  conduct of public affairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 105 <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In particular, it will be to him a matter of <br>
  concern that the law shall be established upon <br>
  classifications which are just (in the sense of <br>
  being conformable to public advantage); and <br>
  that the laws shall everywhere be justly, that <br>
  is to say rigorously and impartially, adminis- <br>
  tered. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we now turn to the man in the street we <br>
  shall not find him especially sensible to the <br>
  appeals of morality.&nbsp; But when the special <br>
  call comes it will generally be possible to trust <br>
  him: as an elector, to vote uninfluenced by con- <br>
  siderations of private advantage; and, when <br>
  called to serve on a jury, to apply legal class- <br>
  ifications without distinction of person. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, in all times of crisis he may be <br>
  counted upon to apply the principles of com- <br>
  munal morality which have been handed down <br>
  in the race. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>Titanic</i> disaster, for example, showed <br>
  in a conspicuous manner that the ordinary man <br>
  will, "letting his own life go," obey the com- <br>
  munal law which lays it upon him, when in-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 106 <br>
  volved in a catastrophe, to save first the wo- <br>
  men and children. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, we come to the man who is intoler- <br>
  ant of all the ordinary restraints of personal <br>
  and domestic morality.&nbsp; Even in him the seeds <br>
  of communal morality will often be found <br>
  deeply implanted. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time and again a regiment of scallawags, <br>
  who have let all other morality go hang, have, <br>
  when the proper chord has been made to vi- <br>
  brate in them, heard the call of communal <br>
  morality, and done deeds which make the ears <br>
  of whosoever heareth of them to tingle. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We come into an entirely different land <br>
  when we come to the morality of woman.&nbsp; It <br>
  is personal and domestic, not public, morality <br>
  which is instinctive in her. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, when egoism gives <br>
  ground to altruism, that altruism is exercised <br>
  towards those who are linked up to her by a <br>
  bond of sexual affection, or a community in <br>
  blood, or failing this, by a relation of personal <br>
  friendship, or by some other personal relation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 107 <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And even when altruism has had her perfect <br>
  work, woman feels no interest in, and no re- <br>
  sponsibility towards, any abstract moral ideal. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And though the suffragist may protest, in- <br>
  stancing in disproof of this her own burning <br>
  enthusiasm for justice, we, for our part, may <br>
  legitimately ask whether evidence of a moral <br>
  enthusiasm for justice would be furnished by <br>
  a desire to render to others their due, or by <br>
  vehement insistence upon one's own rights, <br>
  and systematic attempts to extort, under the <br>
  cover of the word "justice," advantages for <br>
  oneself. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it will be well to dwell a little longer <br>
  on, and to bring out more clearly, the point <br>
  that woman's moral ideals are personal and <br>
  domestic, as distinguished from impersonal <br>
  and public. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us note in this connexion that it would <br>
  be difficult to conceive of a woman who had <br>
  become deaf to the appeal of personal and do- <br>
  mestic morality making it a matter of <i>amour</i> <br>
  <i>propre</i> to respond to a call of public morality;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 108 <br>
  and difficult to conceive of a woman recover- <br>
  ing lost self-respect by fulfilling such an obli- <br>
  gation. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But one knows that woman will rise and re- <br>
  spond to the call of any strong human or trans- <br>
  cendental personal affection. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, it is only a very exceptional woman <br>
  who would, when put to her election between <br>
  the claims of a narrow and domestic and a <br>
  wider or public morality, subordinate the <br>
  former to the latter. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In ordinary life, at any rate, one finds her <br>
  following in such a case the suggestions of <br>
  domestic--I had almost called it animal--mor- <br>
  ality. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be difficult to find any one who <br>
  would trust a woman to be just to the rights <br>
  of others in the case where the material in- <br>
  terests of her children, or of a devoted hus- <br>
  band, were involved.&nbsp; And even to consider <br>
  the question of being in such a case intellec- <br>
  tually just to any one who came into competi- <br>
  tion with personal belongings like husband and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 109 <br>
  child would, of course, lie quite beyond the <br>
  moral horizon of ordinary woman. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not only the fact that the ideals of <br>
  abstract justice and truth would inevitably <br>
  be brushed aside by woman in the interests of <br>
  those she loves which comes into consideration <br>
  here; it is also the fact that woman is almost <br>
  without a moral sense in the matter of execut- <br>
  ing a public trust such as voting or attaching <br>
  herself to a political association with a view <br>
  to influencing votes. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is between man and woman here a <br>
  characteristic difference. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While it is, of course, not a secret to any- <br>
  body that the baser sort of man can at any <br>
  time be diverted from the path of public mor- <br>
  ality by a monetary bribe or other personal <br>
  advantage, he will not, at any rate, set at <br>
  naught all public morality by doing so for a <br>
  peppercorn.&nbsp; He will, for instance, not join, <br>
  for the sake of a daughter, a political move- <br>
  ment in which he has no belief; nor vote for this <br>
  or that candidate just to please a son; or cen-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 110 <br>
  sure a member of Parliament who has in vot- <br>
  ing on female suffrage failed to consider the <br>
  predilections of his wife. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But woman, whether she be politically en- <br>
  franchised as in Australasia, or unenfran- <br>
  chised as at home; whether she be immoral in <br>
  the sense of being purely egoistic, or moral in <br>
  the sense of being altruistic, very rarely makes <br>
  any secret or any shame of doing these things. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this matter one would not be very far <br>
  from the truth if one alleged that there are no <br>
  good women, but only women who have lived <br>
  under the influence of good men. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even more serious than this postponement <br>
  of public to private morality is the fact that <br>
  even reputedly ethical women will, in the in- <br>
  terests of what they take to be idealistic causes, <br>
  violate laws which are universally accepted as <br>
  being of moral obligation. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I here pass over the recent epidemic of polit- <br>
  ical crime among women to advert to the want <br>
  of conscience which permits, in connexion with <br>
  professedly idealistic causes, not only misrepre-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 111 <br>
  sentations, but the making of deliberately false <br>
  statements on matters of public concern. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is, for example, an illustration of the pro- <br>
  foundly different moral atmospheres in which <br>
  men and women live that when a public woman <br>
  recently made, for what was to her an idealistic <br>
  purpose, a deliberately false statement of fact <br>
  in <i>The Times</i>, she quite na&iuml;vely confessed to <br>
  it, seeing nothing whatever amiss in her ac- <br>
  tion. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it did not appear that any other woman <br>
  suffragist could discern any kind of immoral- <br>
  ity in it.&nbsp; The worst thing they could find to <br>
  say was that it perhaps was a little <i>gauche</i> <br>
  to confess to making a deliberately false state- <br>
  ment on a public question when it was for the <br>
  moment particularly desirable that woman <br>
  should show up to best advantage before the <br>
  eyes of man. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may now for a moment put aside the <br>
  question of woman's public morality and con- <br>
  sider a question which is inextricably mixed up&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 112 <br>
  with the question of the admission of woman <br>
  to the suffrage.&nbsp; This is the mental attitude <br>
  and the programme of the female legislative <br>
  reformer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>MENTAL OUTLOOK AND PROGRAMME OF <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; THE FEMALE LEGISLATIVE REFORMER </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T<font size="-1">HE</font> suffragist woman, when she
 is the kind <br>
  of woman who piques herself upon her ethical <br>
  impulses, will, even when she is intellectually <br>
  very poorly equipped, and there is no imprint <br>
  of altruism upon her life, assure you that noth- <br>
  ing except the moral influence of woman, ex- <br>
  erted through the legislation, which her prac- <br>
  tical mind would be capable of initiating, will <br>
  ever avail to abate existing social evils, and to <br>
  effect the moral redemption of the world. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will not be amiss first to try to introduce <br>
  a little clearness and order into our ideas upon <br>
  those formidably difficult problems which the <br>
  female legislative reformer desires to attack, <br>
  and then to consider how a rational reforming <br>
  mind would go to work in the matter of pro- <br>
  posing legislation for these.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 114 <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>First</i> would come those evils which result <br>
  from individuals seeking advantage to them- <br>
  selves by the direct infliction of injury upon <br>
  others.&nbsp; Violations of the criminal law and the <br>
  various forms of sweating and fleecing one's <br>
  fellow-men come under this category. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Then</i> would come the evils which arise out of
<br>
  purveying physiological and psychological re- <br>
  freshments and excitements, which are, ac- <br>
  cording as they are indulged in temperately or <br>
  intemperately, grateful and innocuous, or <br>
  sources of disaster and ruin.&nbsp; The evils which <br>
  are associated with the drink traffic and the <br>
  betting industry are typical examples. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Finally,</i> there would come into consideration
<br>
  the evils of death or physical suffering deliber- <br>
  ately inflicted by man upon man with a view to <br>
  preventing worse evils.&nbsp; The evil of war would <br>
  come under this category.&nbsp; In this same cate- <br>
  gory might also come the much lesser evil of <br>
  punitive measures inflicted upon criminals. <br>
  And with this might be coupled the evil of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 115 <br>
  killing and inflicting physical suffering upon <br>
  animals for the advantage of man. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may now consider how the rational legis- <br>
  lative reformer would in each case go to <br>
  work. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He would not start with the assumption that <br>
  it <i>must</i> be possible by some alteration of the <br>
  law to abolish or conspicuously reduce any of <br>
  the afore-mentioned evils; nor yet with the as- <br>
  sumption that, if a particular alteration of the <br>
  law would avail to bring about this result, that <br>
  alteration ought necessarily to be made.&nbsp; He <br>
  would recognise that many things which are <br>
  theoretically desirable are unattainable; and <br>
  that many legislative measures which could <br>
  perfectly well be enforced would be barred by <br>
  the fact that they would entail deplorable un- <br>
  intended consequences. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rational legislator whom we have here <br>
  in view would accordingly always take expert <br>
  advice as to whether the desired object could <br>
  be achieved by legal compulsion; and as to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 116 <br>
  whether a projected law which satisfied the <br>
  condition of being workable would give a bal- <br>
  ance of advantages over disadvantages. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In connexion with a proposal for the pre- <br>
  vention of sweating he would, for instance, <br>
  take expert advice as to whether its provisions <br>
  could be enforced; and whether, if enforce- <br>
  able, they would impose added hardships on <br>
  any class of employees or penalties on any in- <br>
  nocent class of employers. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In like manner in connexion with a pro- <br>
  posed modification in criminal procedure, the <br>
  rational reformer would defer to the expert <br>
  on the question as to whether such modification <br>
  would secure greater certainty of punishment <br>
  for the guilty without increasing the risk of <br>
  convicting the innocent. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In connexion with the second category of <br>
  evils--the category under which would come <br>
  those of drinking and betting--the rational <br>
  legislative reformer would recognise the com- <br>
  plete impracticability of abolishing by legis-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 117 <br>
  lative prohibition physiological indulgences <br>
  and the evils which sometimes attend upon <br>
  them. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He would consider instead whether these at- <br>
  tendant evils could be reduced by making the <br>
  regulating laws more stringent; and whether <br>
  more stringent restrictions--in addition to <br>
  the fact that they would filch from the all too <br>
  small stock of human happiness--would not, <br>
  by paving the way for further invasions of per- <br>
  sonal liberty, cripple the free development of <br>
  the community. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the former question, which only experts <br>
  could properly answer, the reasonable reformer <br>
  would defer to their advice.&nbsp; The answer to <br>
  the last question he would think out for him- <br>
  self. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In connexion with the evils which are de- <br>
  liberately inflicted by man with a view to reap- <br>
  ing either personal profit, or profit for the na- <br>
  tion, or profit for humanity, the reasonable <br>
  reformer would begin by making clear to <br>
  himself that the world we live in is not such&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 118 <br>
  a world as idealism might conjure up, but a <br>
  world of violence, in which life must be taken <br>
  and physical suffering be inflicted. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he would recognise that the vital <br>
  material interests of the nation can be pro- <br>
  tected only by armed force; that civilisation <br>
  can be safeguarded only by punishing viola- <br>
  tions of the criminal law; and that the taking <br>
  of animal life and the infliction of a certain <br>
  amount of physical suffering upon animals is <br>
  essential to human well-being, comfort, and <br>
  recreation; and essential also to the achieve- <br>
  ment of the knowledge which is required to <br>
  combat disease. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the reasonable reformer will, in con- <br>
  formity with this, direct his efforts, not to the <br>
  total abolition of war, but to the prevention of <br>
  such wars as are not waged for really vital <br>
  material interests, and to the abatement of the <br>
  ferocities of warfare. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of punishment for criminals he <br>
  would similarly devote his efforts not to the <br>
  abrogation of punishments, but to the relin-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 119 <br>
  quishment of any that are not reformatory, or <br>
  really deterrent. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In like manner the reasonable reformer <br>
  would not seek to prohibit the slaughtering of <br>
  animals for food, or the killing off of animal <br>
  pests, or the trapping, shooting, or hunting of <br>
  animals for sport or profit, nor yet would he <br>
  seek to prevent their utilisation of animals for <br>
  the acquirement of knowledge. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He would direct his efforts to reducing the <br>
  pain which is inflicted, and to preserving every- <br>
  where measure and scale--not sentimentally <br>
  forbidding in connexion with one form of <br>
  utilisation of animals what is freely allowed <br>
  in connexion with another--but differentia- <br>
  ting, if differentiating at all in favour of per- <br>
  mitting the infliction of proportionately greater <br>
  suffering in the case where national and hu- <br>
  manitarian interests, than in the case where <br>
  mere recreation and luxury and personal <br>
  profit, are at stake. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having recognised what reason would pre- <br>
  scribe to the legislative reformer, we have next&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 120 <br>
  to inquire how far the man voter conforms to <br>
  these prescriptions of reason, and how far the <br>
  woman reformer would do so if she became <br>
  a voter. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let it be noted that the man in the street <br>
  makes no question about falling in with the <br>
  fact that he is born into a world of violence, <br>
  and he acquiesces in the principle that the <br>
  State, and, failing the State, the individual, <br>
  may employ force and take life in defence <br>
  of vital material interests.&nbsp; And he frankly <br>
  falls in with it being a matter of daily <br>
  routine to kill and inflict suffering upon ani- <br>
  mals for human profit or advantage. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if these principles are not formulated <br>
  by the man in the street in quite such plain <br>
  terms, he not only carries them out in practice, <br>
  but he conducts all his thinking upon these pre- <br>
  suppositions. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He, for instance, would fall in with the prop- <br>
  osition that morality does not require from <br>
  man that he should give up taking life <br>
  or inflicting physical suffering.&nbsp; And he would&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 121 <br>
  not cavil with the statement that man should <br>
  put reasonable limits to the amount of suffer- <br>
  ing he inflicts, and confine this within as nar- <br>
  row a range as possible--always requiring for <br>
  the death or suffering inflicted some tangible <br>
  advantage. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, if the question should be raised <br>
  as to whether such advantage will result, the <br>
  ordinary man will as a rule, where the matter <br>
  lies beyond his personal ken, take expert opin- <br>
  ion before intervening. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He will, for instance, be prepared to be so <br>
  guided in connexion with such questions as <br>
  whether disease could, if more knowledge were <br>
  available, be to a large extent prevented and <br>
  cured; as to how far animal experiments would <br>
  contribute to the acquirement of that knowl- <br>
  edge; and as to how far the physical suffer- <br>
  ing which might be involved in these experi- <br>
  ments can be minimised or abolished. <br>
  But not every man is prepared to fall in <br>
  with this programme of inflicting physical suf- <br>
  fering for the relief of physical suffering.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 122 <br>
  There is also a type of spiritually-minded man <br>
  who in this world of violence sets his face un- <br>
  compromisingly against the taking of any <br>
  life and the infliction of any physical suffer- <br>
  ing--refusing to make himself a partaker of <br>
  evil. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An idealist of this type will, like Tolstoy, <br>
  be an anti-militarist.&nbsp; He will advocate a gen- <br>
  eral gaol delivery for criminals.&nbsp; He will be a <br>
  vegetarian.&nbsp; He will not allow an animal's <br>
  life to be taken in his house, though the mice <br>
  scamper over his floors.&nbsp; And he will, consist- <br>
  ently with his conviction that it is immoral to <br>
  resort to force, refuse to take any part in legis- <br>
  lation or government. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This attitude, which is that commended by <br>
  the Hindoo and the Buddhist religions, is, of <br>
  course, a quite unpractical attitude towards <br>
  life.&nbsp; It is, in fact, a self-destructive attitude, <br>
  unless a man's fellow-citizens are prepared by <br>
  forcible means to secure to him the enjoyment <br>
  of the work of his hands or of his inherited <br>
  property, or unless those who refuse to desist&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 123 <br>
  from the exercise of force are prepared to un- <br>
  take the support of idealists. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have not only these two classes of men-- <br>
  the ordinary man who has no compunction in <br>
  resorting to force when the requirements of life <br>
  demand it, and the idealist who refuses to have <br>
  any lot or part in violence; there is also a hy- <br>
  brid.&nbsp; This male hybrid will descant on the <br>
  general iniquity of violence, and then not only <br>
  connive at those forms of violence which min- <br>
  ister to his personal comforts, but also make <br>
  a virtue of trying to abate by legal violence <br>
  some particular form of physical suffering <br>
  which happens to offend in a quite special man- <br>
  ner his individual sensibility. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is absolutely nothing to be said about <br>
  this kind of reforming crank, except only that <br>
  anything which may be said in relation to the <br>
  female legislative reformer may be appositely <br>
  said of him; and perhaps also this, that the <br>
  ordinary man holds him both in intellectual <br>
  and in moral contempt, and is resolved not to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 124 <br>
  allow him to do any really serious injury to <br>
  the community. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To become formidable this quasi-male per- <br>
  son must, as he recognises, ally himself with <br>
  the female legislative reformer. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Passing on to deal with her, it imports us first <br>
  to realise that while the male voter has--ex- <br>
  cept where important constitutional issues <br>
  were in question--been accustomed to leave <br>
  actual legislation to the expert, the female re- <br>
  former gives notice beforehand that she will, <br>
  as soon as ever she gets the suffrage, insist <br>
  on pressing forward by her vote her reform- <br>
  ing schemes. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What would result from the ordinary voter <br>
  legislating on matters which require expert <br>
  knowledge will be plain to every one who will <br>
  consider the evolution of law. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There stand over against each other here, as <br>
  an example and a warning, the Roman Law, <br>
  which was the creation of legal experts: the <br>
  pr&aelig;tor and the jurisconsult; and the legal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 125 <br>
  system of the Greeks, which was the creation <br>
  of a popular assembly--and it was a popu- <br>
  lar assembly which was quite ideally intelli- <br>
  gent. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the Roman Law has been built the law <br>
  of the greater part of the civilised world.&nbsp; The <br>
  Greek is a by-word for inconsequence. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can one, then, without cold shudders <br>
  think of that legal system which the female <br>
  amateur legal reformer would bring to the <br>
  birth? <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us consider her qualifications.&nbsp; Let us <br>
  first take cognisance of the fact that the re- <br>
  forming woman will neither stand to the prin- <br>
  ciple that man may, where this gives a balance <br>
  of advantage, inflict on his fellow-man, and <i>a</i> <br>
  <i>fortiori</i> upon animals, death and physical suf- <br>
  fering; nor yet will she stand to the principle <br>
  that it is ethically unlawful to do deeds of vio- <br>
  lence. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She spends her life halting between these <br>
  two opinions, eternally shilly-shallying. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She will, for instance, begin by announcing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 126 <br>
  that it can never be lawful to do evil that good <br>
  may come; and that killing and inflicting suf- <br>
  fering is an evil.&nbsp; (In reality the precept of <br>
  not doing evil that good may come has rela- <br>
  tion only to breaking for idealistic purposes <br>
  moral laws of higher obligation.)&nbsp; She will <br>
  then go back upon that and concede that war <br>
  may sometimes be lawful, and that the punish- <br>
  ment of criminals is not an evil.&nbsp; But if her <br>
  emotions are touched by the forcible feeding <br>
  of a criminal militant suffragist, she will again <br>
  go back upon that and declare that the appli- <br>
  cation of force is an intolerable evil. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or, again, she will concede that the slaugh- <br>
  tering of animals for food is not an evil, but <br>
  that what is really unforgivable is the infliction <br>
  of physical suffering on animals.&nbsp; And all the <br>
  time for her, as well as for man, calves and <br>
  lambs are being emasculated to make her meat <br>
  succulent; wild animals are painfully done to <br>
  death to provide her table with delicacies; <br>
  birds with young in the nest are shot so that <br>
  she may parade in their plumage; or fur-bear-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 127 <br>
  ing animals are for her comfort and adorn- <br>
  ment massacred and tortured in traps. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a man crank who is co-responsible <br>
  for these things begins to talk idealistic re- <br>
  forms, the ordinary decent man refuses to <br>
  have anything more to say to him. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when a woman crank holds this lan- <br>
  guage, the man merely shrugs his shoulders. <br>
  "It is," he tells himself, "after all, the woman <br>
  whom God gave him." <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It must be confessed that the problem as to <br>
  how man with a dual nature may best accom- <br>
  modate himself to a world of violence pre- <br>
  sents a very difficult problem. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would obviously be no solution to follow <br>
  out everywhere a programme of violence. <br>
  Not even the predatory animals do that. <br>
  Tigers do not savage their cubs; hawks do not <br>
  pluck hawks' eyes; and dogs do not fight <br>
  bitches. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor would, as has been shown, the solution <br>
  of the problem be arrived at by everywhere <br>
  surrendering--if we had been given the grace&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 128 <br>
  to do this--to the compunctious visitings of <br>
  nature. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is required is to find the proper com- <br>
  promise.&nbsp; As to what that would be there is, <br>
  as between the ordinary man and woman on <br>
  the one side, and the male crank and the <br>
  battalions of sentimental women on the other, <br>
  a conflict which is, to all intents and purposes, <br>
  a sex war. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The compromise which ordinary human na- <br>
  ture had fixed upon--and it is one which, min- <br>
  istering as it does to the survival of the race, <br>
  has been adopted through the whole range of <br>
  nature--is that of making within the world in <br>
  which violence rules a series of enclaves in <br>
  which the application of violence is progres- <br>
  sively restricted and limited. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside the outermost of the series of ring <br>
  fences thus constituted would be the realm of <br>
  uncompromising violence such as exists when <br>
  human life is endangered by wild animals, or <br>
  murderous criminals, or savages.&nbsp; Just within <br>
  this outermost fence would be civilised war--&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 129 <br>
  for in civilised war non-combatants and prison- <br>
  ers and wounded are excluded from the appli- <br>
  cation of violence.&nbsp; In like manner we bring <br>
  humanity in general within a more sheltered <br>
  enclosure than animals--pet animals within a <br>
  more sheltered enclosure than other animals. <br>
  Again, we bring those who belong to the white <br>
  race within a narrower protecting circle than <br>
  mankind in general, and those of our own na- <br>
  tion within a still narrower one. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following out the same principle, we in- <br>
  clude women and children within a narrower <br>
  shelter fence than our adult fellow-male; and <br>
  we use the weapon of force more reluctantly <br>
  when we are dealing with our relatives and <br>
  friends than when we are dealing with those <br>
  who are not personally known to us; and <br>
  finally, we lay it aside more completely when <br>
  we are dealing with the women of our house- <br>
  holds than when we are dealing with the <br>
  males. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cause of civilisation and of the amenities, <br>
  and the welfare of the nation, of the family,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 130 <br>
  and of woman, are all intimately bound up with <br>
  a faithful adherence to this compromise. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this policy imposes upon those whom <br>
  it shelters from violence corresponding obliga- <br>
  tions. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In war non-combatants--not to speak of the <br>
  wounded on the battlefield--must desist from <br>
  hostile action on the pain of being shot down <br>
  like wild beasts.&nbsp; And though an individual <br>
  non-combatant might think it a patriotic action <br>
  for him to take part in war, the thoughtful <br>
  man would recognise that such action was a <br>
  violation of a well-understood covenant made <br>
  in the interest of civilisation, and that to break <br>
  through this covenant was to abrogate a hu- <br>
  manitarian arrangement by which the general <br>
  body of non-combatants immensely benefits. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exactly the same principle finds, as already <br>
  pointed out, application when a woman em- <br>
  ploys direct violence, or aspires to exercise by <br>
  voting indirect violence. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One always wonders if the suffragist appre- <br>
  ciates all that woman stands to lose and all&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 131 <br>
  that she imperils by resort to physical force. <br>
  One ought not to have to tell her that, if she <br>
  had to fight for her position, her status would <br>
  be that which is assigned to her among the <br>
  Kaffirs--not that which civilised man concedes <br>
  to her. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From considering the compromise by which <br>
  man adapts his dual nature to violence in the <br>
  world, we turn to that which the female legis- <br>
  lative reformer would seek to impose by the <br>
  aid of her vote. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her proposal, as the reader will have dis- <br>
  cerned, would be that all those evils which make <br>
  appeal to the feminine emotions should be <br>
  legally prohibited, and that all those which fail <br>
  to make this appeal shall be tolerated. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the former class would be included those <br>
  which come directly under woman's ken, or <br>
  have been brought vividly before the eyes of <br>
  her imagination by emotional description. <br>
  And the specially intolerable evils will be those <br>
  which, owing to the fact that they fall upon <br>
  woman or her immediate belongings, induce&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 132 <br>
  in the female legislative reformer pangs of <br>
  sympathetic discomfort. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the class of evils which the suffragist is <br>
  content to tolerate, or say nothing about, would <br>
  be those which are incapable of evoking in her <br>
  such sympathetic pangs, and she concerns her- <br>
  self very little with those evils which do not <br>
  furnish her with a text for recriminations <br>
  against man. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conspicuous in this programme is the ab- <br>
  sence of any sense of proportion.&nbsp; One would <br>
  have imagined that it would have been plain <br>
  to everybody that the evils which individual <br>
  women suffer at the hands of man are very far <br>
  from being the most serious ills of humanity. <br>
  One would have imagined that the suffering <br>
  inflicted by disease and by bad social condi- <br>
  tions--suffering which falls upon man and <br>
  woman alike--deserved a first place in the <br>
  thoughts of every reformer.&nbsp; And one might <br>
  have expected it to be common knowledge that <br>
  the wrongs individual men inflict upon women <br>
  have a full counterpart in the wrongs which&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 133 <br>
  individual women inflict upon men.&nbsp; It may <br>
  quite well be that there are mists which here <br>
  "blot and fill the perspective" of the female <br>
  legislative reformer.&nbsp; But to look only upon <br>
  one's own things, and not also upon the things <br>
  of others, is not for that morally innocent. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is further to be noted in connexion <br>
  with the female legislative reformer that she <br>
  has never been able to see why she should be <br>
  required to put her aspirations into practical <br>
  shape, or to consider ways and means, or to <br>
  submit the practicability of her schemes to ex- <br>
  pert opinion.&nbsp; One also recognises that from <br>
  a purely human point of view such tactics are <br>
  judicious.&nbsp; For if the schemes of the fe- <br>
  male legislative reformer were once to be re- <br>
  viewed from the point of view of their prac- <br>
  ticability, her utility as a legislator would come <br>
  into question, and the suffragist could no <br>
  longer give out that there has been committed <br>
  to her from on High a mission to draw water <br>
  for man-kind out of the wells of salvation. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, we have to reflect in connection with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 134 <br>
  the female legislative reformer that to go about <br>
  proposing to reform the laws means to aban- <br>
  don that special field of usefulness which lies <br>
  open to woman in alleviating misery and re- <br>
  dressing those hard cases which will, under all <br>
  laws and regulations of human manufacture <br>
  and under all social dispositions, inevitably <br>
  occur.&nbsp; Now when a woman leaves a social <br>
  task which is commensurate with her abilities, <br>
  and which asks from her personal effort and <br>
  self-sacrifice, for a task which is quite beyond <br>
  her abilities, but which, she thinks, will bring <br>
  her personal kudos, shall we impute it to her <br>
  for righteousness?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>ULTERIOR ENDS WHICH THE WOMAN'S SUF- <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FRAGE MOVEMENT HAS IN
VIEW  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; W<font size="-1">E</font> have now sufficiently considered
 the <br>
  suffragist's humanitarian schemes, and we <br>
  may lead up to the consideration of her further <br>
  projects by contrasting woman's suffrage as it <br>
  presents itself under colonial conditions--<i>i.e.</i> <br>
  woman's suffrage without the female legisla- <br>
  tive reformer and the feminist--with the <br>
  woman suffrage which is being agitated for in <br>
  England--<i>i.e.</i> woman suffrage with the fe- <br>
  male legislative reformer and the feminist. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the colonies and undeveloped countries <br>
  generally where women are in a minority, and <br>
  where owing to the fact that practically all <br>
  have an opportunity of marrying, there are not <br>
  for woman any difficult economic and physio- <br>
  logical conditions, there is no woman's ques-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 136 <br>
  tion; and by consequence no female legislative <br>
  reformer or feminist.&nbsp; The woman voter fol- <br>
  lows, as the opportunist politicians who en- <br>
  franchised her intended, the lead of her men- <br>
  folk--serving only a pawn in the game of pol- <br>
  itics.&nbsp; Under such conditions woman's suf- <br>
  frage leaves things as they are, except only <br>
  that it undermines the logical foundations of <br>
  the law, and still further debases the standard <br>
  of public efficiency and public morality. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In countries, such as England, where an ex- <br>
  cess female population <sup><font size="-2">1</font></sup> has made economic
 <br>
  difficulties for woman, and where the severe <br>
  sexual restrictions, which here obtains, have <br>
  bred in her sex-hostility, the suffrage move- <br>
  ment has as its avowed ulterior object the abro- <br>
  gation of all distinctions which depend upon <br>
  sex; and the achievement of the economic inde- <br>
  pendence of woman. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To secure this economic independence every <br>
  post, occupation, and Government service is to </p>

<p><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><sup><font size="-2">1</font></sup><font size="-1">
   In England and Wales there are, in a population of 8,000,-</font> <br>

<p>be thrown open to woman; she is to receive <br>
  everywhere the same wages as man; male and <br>
  female are to work side by side; and they are <br>
  indiscriminately to be put in command the one <br>
  over the other.&nbsp; Furthermore, legal rights are <br>
  to be secured to the wife over her husband's <br>
  property and earnings.&nbsp; The programme is, <br>
  in fact, to give to woman an economic inde- <br>
  pendence out of the earnings and taxes of <br>
  man. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor does feminist ambition stop short here. <br>
  It demands that women shall be included in <br>
  every advisory committee, every governing <br>
  board, every jury, every judicial bench, every <br>
  electorate, every parliament, and every minis- <br>
  terial cabinet; further, that every masculine <br>
  foundation, university, school of learning, <br>
  academy, trade union, professional corpora- <br>
  tion and scientific society shall be converted <br>
  into an epicene institution--until we shall have <br>
  everywhere one vast cock-and-hen show. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposal to bring man and woman <br>
  together everywhere into extremely intimate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 138 <br>
  relationships raises very grave questions.&nbsp; It <br>
  brings up, first, the question of sexual compli- <br>
  cations; secondly, the question as to whether <br>
  the tradition of modesty and reticence between <br>
  the sexes is to be definitely sacrificed; and, <br>
  most important of all, the question as to <br>
  whether epicene conditions would place ob- <br>
  stacles in the way of intellectual work. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of these issues the feminist puts the first two <br>
  quite out of account.&nbsp; I have already else- <br>
  where said my say upon these matters.<sup><font size="-2">1</font></sup>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;  With <br>
  regard to the third, the feminist either fails to <br>
  realise that purely intellectual intercourse--as <br>
  distinguished from an intercommunion of men- <br>
  tal images--with woman is to a large section <br>
  of men repugnant; or else, perceiving this, <br>
  she makes up her mind that, this notwithstand- <br>
  ing, she will get her way by denouncing the <br>
  man who does not welcome her as <i>selfish</i>; and <br>
  by insisting that under feminism (the quota- <br>
  tion is from Mill, the italics which question his <br>
  sincerity are mine) "the mass of mental facul- </p>

 139 <br>
  &nbsp; </p>

<p>ties available for the higher service of man- <br>
  kind would be <i>doubled</i>." <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The matter cannot so lightly be disposed of. <br>
  It will be necessary for us to find out whether <br>
  really intimate association with woman on the <br>
  purely intellectual plane is realisable.&nbsp; And if <br>
  it is, in fact, unrealisable, it will be necessary to <br>
  consider whether it is the exclusion of women <br>
  from masculine corporations; or the perpetual <br>
  attempt of women to force their way into these, <br>
  which would deserve to be characterised as <br>
  <i>selfish</i>. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In connexion with the former of these issues, <br>
  we have to consider here not whether that form <br>
  of intellectual co-operation in which the man <br>
  plays the game, and the woman moves the <br>
  pawns under his orders, is possible.&nbsp; That <br>
  form of co-operation is of course possible, and <br>
  it has, doubtless, certain utilities. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor yet have we to consider whether quite <br>
  intimate and purely intellectual association on <br>
  an equal footing between a particular man and <br>
  a selected woman may or may not be possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 140 <br>
  It will suffice to note that the feminist alleges <br>
  that this also is possible; but everybody knows <br>
  that the woman very often marries the man. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we have to ask is whether--even if <br>
  we leave out of regard the whole system of at- <br>
  tractions or, as the case may be, repulsions <br>
  which come into operation when the sexes are <br>
  thrown together--purely intellectual inter- <br>
  course between man and the typical unselected <br>
  woman is not barred by the intellectual im- <br>
  moralities and limitations which appear to be <br>
  secondary sexual characters of woman. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to this issue, there would seem <br>
  to be very little real difference of opinion <br>
  among men.&nbsp; But there are great differences <br>
  in the matter of candour.&nbsp; There are men who <br>
  speak out, and who enunciate like Nietzsche <br>
  that "man and woman are alien--never yet <br>
  has any one conceived how alien." <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are men who, from motives of delicacy <br>
  or policy, do not speak out--averse to saying <br>
  anything that might be unflattering to woman. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And there are men who are by their pro-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 141 <br>
  fession of the feminist faith debarred from <br>
  speaking out, but who upon occasion give <br>
  themselves away. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of such is the man who in the House of <br>
  Commons champions the cause of woman's <br>
  suffrage, impassionately appealing to Justice; <br>
  and then betrays himself by announcing that <br>
  he would shake off from his feet the dust of its <br>
  purlieus if ever women were admitted as mem- <br>
  bers--<i>i.e.</i> if ever women were forced upon <i>him</i> <br>
  as close intellectual associates. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherever we look we find aversion to com- <br>
  pulsory intellectual co-operation with woman. <br>
  We see it in the sullen attitude which the or- <br>
  dinary male student takes up towards the pres- <br>
  ence of women students in his classes.&nbsp; We see <br>
  it in the fact that the older English universi- <br>
  ties, which have conceded everything else to <br>
  women, have made a strong stand against mak- <br>
  ing them actual members of the university; <br>
  for this would impose them on men as intellec- <br>
  tual associates.&nbsp; Again we see the aversion in <br>
  the opposition to the admission of women to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 142 <br>
  the bar.&nbsp; But we need not look so far afield. <br>
  Practically every man feels that there is in <br>
  woman--patent, or hidden away--an element <br>
  of unreason which, when you come upon it, <br>
  summarily puts an end to purely intellectual <br>
  intercourse.&nbsp; One may reflect, for example, <br>
  upon the way the woman's suffrage contro- <br>
  versy has been conducted. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proceeding now on the assumption that <br>
  these things are so, and that man feels that he <br>
  and woman belong to different intellectual <br>
  castes, we come now to the question as to <br>
  whether it is man who is selfish when he ex- <br>
  cludes women from his institutions, or woman <br>
  when she unceasingly importunes for admit- <br>
  tance.&nbsp; And we may define as <i>selfish</i> all such <br>
  conduct as pursues the advantage of the agent <br>
  at the cost of the happiness and welfare of <br>
  the general body of mankind. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We shall be in a better position to pronounce <br>
  judgment on this question of ethics when we <br>
  have considered the following series of analo- <br>
  gies:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 143 <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a group of earnest and devout be- <br>
  lievers meet together for special intercession <br>
  and worship, we do not tax them with selfish- <br>
  ness if they exclude unbelievers. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor do we call people who are really de- <br>
  voted to music selfish if, coming together for <br>
  this, they make a special point of excluding <br>
  the unmusical. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor again would the imputation of selfish- <br>
  ness lie against members of a club for black- <br>
  balling a candidate who would, they feel, be <br>
  uncongenial. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor should we regard it as an act of selfish- <br>
  ness if the members of a family circle, or of <br>
  the same nation, or of any social circle, desired <br>
  to come together quite by themselves. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor yet would the term selfish apply to an <br>
  East End music hall audience when they eject <br>
  any one who belongs to a different social class <br>
  to themselves and wears good clothes. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the like would hold true of servants re- <br>
  senting their employers intruding upon them <br>
  in their hours of leisure or entertainments.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 144 <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we do not characterise such exclusions as <br>
  selfish, but rather respect and sympathise with <br>
  them, it is because we recognise that the whole <br>
  object and <i>raison d' &ecirc;tre</i> of association would <br>
  in each case be nullified by the weak-minded <br>
  admission of the incompatible intruder. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We recognise that if any charge of selfish- <br>
  ness would lie, it would lie against that in- <br>
  truder. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now if this holds in the case where the in- <br>
  terests of religious worship or music, or family, <br>
  national, or social life, or recreation and relax- <br>
  ation after labour are in question, it will hold <br>
  true even more emphatically where the inter- <br>
  ests of intellectual work are involved. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the feminist will want to argue.&nbsp; She <br>
  will--taking it as always for granted that <br>
  woman has a right to all that men's hands or <br>
  brains have fashioned--argue that it is very <br>
  important for the intellectual development of <br>
  woman that she should have exactly the same <br>
  opportunities as man.&nbsp; And she will, scouting [rejecting with contempt]
 <br>
  the idea of any differences between the intelli-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 145 <br>
  gences of man and woman, discourse to you of <br>
  their intimate affinity. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will, perhaps, be well to clear up these <br>
  points. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The importance of the higher development <br>
  of woman is unquestionable. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But after all it is the intellect of man which <br>
  really comes into account in connexion with <br>
  "the mass of mental faculties available for the <br>
  higher service of mankind." <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The maintenance of the conditions which <br>
  allow of man's doing his best intellectual work <br>
  is therefore an interest which is superior to <br>
  that of the intellectual development of woman. <br>
  And woman might quite properly be referred <br>
  for her intellectual development to instruc- <br>
  tional institutions which should be special to <br>
  herself. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coming to the question of the intimate re- <br>
  semblances between the masculine and the <br>
  feminine intelligence, no man would be ven- <br>
  turesome enough to dispute these, but he may&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 146 <br>
  be pardoned if he thinks--one would hope in <br>
  no spirit of exaltation--also of the differences. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have an instructive analogy in connexion <br>
  with the learned societies. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is uncontrovertible that every candidate <br>
  for election into such a society will have, and <br>
  will feel that he has, affinities with the members <br>
  of that association.&nbsp; And he is invited to set <br>
  these forth in his application.&nbsp; But there may <br>
  also be differences of which he is not sensible. <br>
  On that question the electors are the judges; <br>
  and they are the final court of appeal. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There would seem to be here a moral which <br>
  the feminist would do well to lay to heart. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also another lesson which she might <br>
  very profitably consider.&nbsp; A quite small dif- <br>
  ference will often constitute as effective a bar <br>
  to a useful and congenial co-operation as a <br>
  more fundamental difference. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of a body of intellectual workers <br>
  one might at first sight suppose that so small <br>
  a distinction as that of belonging to a different&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 147 <br>
  nationality--sex, of course, is an infinitely pro- <br>
  founder difference--would not be a bar to un- <br>
  restricted intellectual co-operation. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in point of fact it is in every country, <br>
  in every learned society, a uniform rule that <br>
  when foreign scientists or scholars are admitted <br>
  they are placed not on the ordinary list of <br>
  working members, but on a special list. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One discerns that there is justification for <br>
  this in the fact that a foreigner would in cer- <br>
  tain eventualities be an incompatible person. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One may think of the eventuality of the <br>
  learned society deciding to recognise a national <br>
  service, or to take part in a national movement. <br>
  And one is not sure that a foreigner might not <br>
  be an incompatible person in the eventuality <br>
  of a scientist or scholar belonging to a national- <br>
  ity with which the foreigner's country was at <br>
  feud being brought forward for election. <br>
  And he would, of course, be an impossible <br>
  person in a society if he were, in a spirit of <br>
  chauvinism, to press for a larger representa- <br>
  tion of his own fellow-countrymen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 148 <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now this is precisely the kind of way man <br>
  feels about woman.&nbsp; He recognises that she is <br>
  by virtue of her sex for certain purposes an in- <br>
  compatible person; and that, quite apart from <br>
  this, her secondary sexual characters might in <br>
  certain eventualities make her an impossible <br>
  person. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may note, before passing on, that these <br>
  considerations would seem to prescribe that <br>
  woman should be admitted to masculine insti- <br>
  tutions only when real humanitarian grounds <br>
  demand it; that she should--following here the <br>
  analogy of what is done in the learned societies <br>
  with respect to foreigners--be invited to co- <br>
  operate with men only when she is quite spe- <br>
  cially eminent, or beyond all question useful <br>
  for the particular purpose in hand; and lastly, <br>
  that when co-opted into any masculine institu- <br>
  tion woman should always be placed upon a <br>
  special list, to show that it was proposed to con- <br>
  fine her co-operation within certain specified <br>
  limits. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From these general questions, which affect&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 149 <br>
  only the woman with intellectual aspirations, <br>
  we pass to consider what would be the effect <br>
  of feminism upon the rank and file of women <br>
  if it made of these co-partners with man in <br>
  work.&nbsp; They would suffer not only because <br>
  woman's physiological disabilities and the re- <br>
  strictions which arise out of her sex place <br>
  her at a great disadvantage when she has to <br>
  enter into competition with man, but also be- <br>
  cause under feminism man would be less and <br>
  less disposed to take off woman's shoulders a <br>
  part of her burden. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And there can be no dispute that the most <br>
  valuable financial asset of the ordinary woman <br>
  is the possibility that a man may be willing-- <br>
  and may, if only woman is disposed to fulfil her <br>
  part of the bargain, be not only willing but <br>
  anxious--to support her and to secure for her, <br>
  if he can, a measure of that freedom which <br>
  comes from the possession of money. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of this every one who has a real fel- <br>
  low-feeling for woman, and who is concerned <br>
  for her material welfare, as a father is con-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  cerned for his daughter's, will above every- <br>
  thing else desire to nurture and encourage in <br>
  man the sentiment of chivalry, and in woman <br>
  that disposition of mind that makes chivalry <br>
  possible. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the woman workers who have to fight <br>
  the battle of life for themselves would indi- <br>
  rectly profit from this fostering of chivalry; <br>
  for those women who are supported by men do <br>
  not compete in the limited labour market which <br>
  is open to the woman worker. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From every point of view, therefore, except <br>
  perhaps that of the exceptional woman who <br>
  would be able to hold her own against mas- <br>
  culine competition--and men always issue in- <br>
  formal letters of naturalisation to such an ex- <br>
  ceptional woman--the woman suffrage which <br>
  leads up to feminism would be a social disaster.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there then, let us ask ourselves, if the suf- <br>
  frage with its programme of feminism is <br>
  barred as leading to social disaster, any pallia- <br>
  tive or corrective that can be applied to the <br>
  present discontents of woman? <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If such is to be found, it is to be found only <br>
  by placing clearly before us the suffragist's <br>
  grievances. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These grievances are,<i> first,</i> the economic <br>
  difficulties of the woman who seeks to earn her <br>
  living by work other than unskilled manual <br>
  labour; <i>secondly</i>, the difficult physiological <br>
  conditions in which woman is placed by the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 155 <br>
  excess of the female over the male population <br>
  and by her diminished chances of marriage <sup><font size="-2">1</font></sup>
  ; <br>
  and <i>thirdly,</i> the tedium which obsesses the life <br>
  of the woman who is not forced, and cannot <br>
  force herself, to work.&nbsp; On the top of these <br>
  grievances comes the fact that the suffragist <br>
  conceives herself to be harshly and unfairly <br>
  treated by man.&nbsp; This last is the fire which <br>
  sets a light to all the inflammable material. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be quite out of question to discuss <br>
  here the economic and physiological difficulties <br>
  of woman.&nbsp; Only this may be said: it is impos- <br>
  sible, in view of the procession of starved and <br>
  frustrated lives which is continuously filing <br>
  past, to close one's eyes to the urgency of this <br>
  woman's problem. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the primary object of all civilisa- <br>
  tion is to provide for every member of the <br>
  community food and shelter and fulfilment of <br>
  natural cravings.&nbsp; And when, in what passes <br>
  as a civilised community, a whole class is called <br>
  upon to go without any one of these our hu- </p>

<p>man requirements, it is little wonder that it <br>
  should break out. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when a way of escape stands open revolt <br>
  is not morally justified. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, for example, a man who is born into, <br>
  but cannot support himself in, a superior class <br>
  of society is not, as long as he can find a liveli- <br>
  hood abroad in a humbler walk in life, entitled <br>
  to revolt. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No more is the woman who is in economic or <br>
  physiological difficulties.&nbsp; For, if only she has <br>
  the pluck to take it, a way of escape stands <br>
  open to her. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She can emigrate; she can go out from the <br>
  social class in which she is not self-supporting <br>
  into a humbler social class in which she could <br>
  earn a living; and she can forsake conditions <br>
  in which she must remain a spinster for con- <br>
  ditions in which she may perhaps become a <br>
  mother.&nbsp; Only in this way can the problem of <br>
  finding work, and relief of tedium, for the <br>
  woman who now goes idle be resolved. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If women were to avail themselves of these&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 157 <br>
  ways of escape out of unphysiological condi- <br>
  tions, the woman agitator would probably find <br>
  it as difficult to keep alive a passionate agita- <br>
  tion for woman suffrage as the Irish Nation- <br>
  alist agitator to keep alive, after the settlement <br>
  of the land question and the grant of old age <br>
  pensions, a passionate agitation for a separate <br>
  Parliament for Ireland. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the happy wife and mother is never pas- <br>
  sionately concerned about the suffrage.&nbsp; It is <br>
  always the woman who is galled either by phy- <br>
  siological hardships, or by the fact that she has <br>
  not the same amount of money as man, or by <br>
  the fact that man does not desire her as a co- <br>
  partner in work, and withholds the homage <br>
  which she thinks he ought to pay to her intel- <br>
  lect. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this class of grievances the present edu- <br>
  cation of woman is responsible.&nbsp; The girl who is <br>
  growing up to woman's estate is never taught <br>
  where she stands relatively to man.&nbsp; She <br>
  is not taught anything about woman's phys- <br>
  ical disabilities.&nbsp; She is not told--she is left&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 158 <br>
  to discover it for herself when too late--that <br>
  child and husband are to woman physiological <br>
  requirements.&nbsp; She is not taught the defects <br>
  and limitations of the feminine mind.&nbsp; One <br>
  might almost think there were no such defects <br>
  and limitations; and that woman was not al- <br>
  ways overestimating her intellectual power. <br>
  And the ordinary girl is not made to realise <br>
  woman's intrinsically inferior money-earning <br>
  capacity.&nbsp; She is not made to realise that the <br>
  woman who cannot work with her hands is <br>
  generally hard put to earn enough to keep her- <br>
  self alive in the incomplete condition of&nbsp; a <br>
  spinster. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of such education, when, influ- <br>
  enced by the feminist movement, woman comes <br>
  to institute a comparison between herself and <br>
  man, she brings into that comparison all those <br>
  qualities in which she is substantially his equal, <br>
  and leaves out of account all those in which she <br>
  is his inferior. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The failure to recognise that man is the mas- <br>
  ter, and why he is the master, lies at the root&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 159 <br>
  of the suffrage movement.&nbsp; By disregarding <br>
  man's superior physical force, the power of <br>
  compulsion upon which all government is based <br>
  is disregarded.&nbsp; By leaving out of account <br>
  those powers of the mind in which man is the <br>
  superior, woman falls into the error of thinking <br>
  that she can really compete with him, and that <br>
  she belongs to the self-same intellectual caste. <br>
  Finally, by putting out of sight man's superior <br>
  money-earning capacity, the power of the <br>
  purse is ignored. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uninstructed woman commits also another <br>
  fundamental error in her comparison.&nbsp; Instead <br>
  of comparing together the average man and <br>
  the average woman, she sets herself to estab- <br>
  lish that there is no defect in woman which can- <br>
  not be discovered also in man; and that there <br>
  is no virtue or power in the ordinary man which <br>
  cannot be discovered also in woman.&nbsp; Which <br>
  having been established to her satisfaction, she <br>
  is led inevitably to the conclusion that there is <br>
  nothing whatever to choose between the sexes. <br>
  And from this there is only a step to the posi-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 160 <br>
  tion that human beings ought to be assigned, <br>
  without distinction of sex, to each and every <br>
  function which would come within the range <br>
  of their individual capacities, instead of being <br>
  assigned as they are at present: men to one <br>
  function, and women to another. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here again women ought to have been safe- <br>
  guarded by education.&nbsp; She ought to have <br>
  been taught that even when an individual <br>
  woman comes up to the average of man this <br>
  does not abrogate the disqualification which <br>
  attaches to a difference of sex.&nbsp; Nor yet--as <br>
  every one who recognises that we live in a <br>
  world which conducts itself by generalisations <br>
  will see--does it abrogate the disqualification <br>
  of belonging to an inferior intellectual caste. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The present system of feminine education is <br>
  blameworthy not only in the respect that it <br>
  fails to draw attention to these disqualifications <br>
  and to teach woman where she stands; it is even <br>
  more blameworthy in that it fails to convey <br>
  to the girl who is growing up any conception <br>
  of that absolutely elementary form of morality&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 161 <br>
  which consists in distinguishing <i>meum</i> and <br>
  <i>tuum </i>[<i>that which is mine</i> and <i>that which is yours</i>].
<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of her educators encouraging every <br>
  girl to assert "rights" as against man, and put <br>
  forward claims, they ought to teach her with <br>
  respect to him those lessons of behaviour which <br>
  are driven home once for all into every boy at <br>
  a public school. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as there you learn that you may not <br>
  make unwarranted demands upon your fel- <br>
  low, and just as in the larger world every na- <br>
  tion has got to learn that it cannot with im- <br>
  punity lay claim to the possessions of its neigh- <br>
  bours, so woman will have to learn that when <br>
  things are not offered to her, and she has not <br>
  the power to take them by force, she has got <br>
  to make the best of things as they are. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One would wish for every girl who is grow- <br>
  ing up to womanhood that it might be brought <br>
  home to her by some refined and ethically- <br>
  minded member of her own sex how insuffer- <br>
  able a person woman becomes when, like a <br>
  spoilt child, she exploits the indulgence of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 162 <br>
  man; when she proclaims that it is his duty <br>
  to serve her and to share with her his power <br>
  and possessions; when she makes an outcry <br>
  when he refuses to part with what is his own; <br>
  and when she insists upon thrusting her society <br>
  upon men everywhere. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And every girl ought to be warned that to <br>
  embark upon a policy of recrimination when <br>
  you do not get what you want, and to pro- <br>
  claim yourself a martyr when, having hit, you <br>
  are hit back, is the way to get yourself thor- <br>
  oughly disliked. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, every girl ought to be shown, in the <br>
  example of the militant suffragist, how revolt <br>
  and martyrdom, undertaken in order to possess <br>
  oneself of what belongs to others, effects the <br>
  complete disorganisation of moral character. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No one would wish that in the education of <br>
  girls these quite unlovely things should be in- <br>
  sisted upon more than was absolutely neces- <br>
  sary.&nbsp; But one would wish that the educators <br>
  of the rising generation of women should, bas- <br>
  ing themselves upon these foundations, point&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 163 <br>
  out to every girl how great is woman's debt to <br>
  civilisation; in other words, how much is under <br>
  civilisation done for woman by man. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one would wish that, in a world which is <br>
  rendered unwholesome by feminism, every <br>
  girl's eyes were opened to comprehend the <br>
  great outstanding fact of the world: the fact <br>
  that, turn where you will, you find individ- <br>
  ual man showering upon individual woman-- <br>
  one man in tribute to her enchantment, an- <br>
  other out of a sense of gratitude, and another <br>
  just because she is something that is his--every <br>
  good thing which, suffrage or no suffrage, she <br>
  never could have procured for herself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>S<font size="-1">IR</font>,--For man the physiological psychology <br>
  of woman is full of difficulties. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is not a little mystified when he encoun- <br>
  ters in her periodically recurring phases of <br>
  hypersensitiveness, unreasonableness, and loss <br>
  of the sense of proportion. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is frankly perplexed when confronted <br>
  with a complete alteration of character in a <br>
  woman who is child-bearing. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he is a witness of the "tendency of <br>
  woman to morally warp when nervously ill," <br>
  and of the terrible physical havoc which the <br>
  pangs of a disappointed love may work, he is <br>
  appalled. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it leaves on his mind an eerie feeling <br>
  when he sees serious and long-continued men- <br>
  tal disorders developing in connexion with the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  approaching extinction of a woman's repro- <br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for woman herself, she makes very light <br>
  of any of these mental upsettings. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She perhaps smiles a little at them. . . .<sup><font size="-2">
  1</font></sup> <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None the less, these upsettings of her men- <br>
  tal equilibrium are the things that a woman <br>
  has most cause to fear; and no doctor can ever <br>
  lose sight of the fact that the mind of woman <br>
  is always threatened with danger from the <br>
  reverberations of her physiological emer- <br>
  gencies. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is with such thoughts that the doctor lets <br>
  his eyes rest upon the militant suffragist.&nbsp; He <br>
  cannot shut them to the fact that there is </p>

<p>mixed up with the woman's movement much <br>
  mental disorder; and he cannot conceal from <br>
  himself the physiological emergencies which lie <br>
  behind. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The recruiting field for the militant suf- <br>
  fragists is the million of our excess female <br>
  population--that million which had better long <br>
  ago have gone out to mate with its comple- <br>
  ment of men beyond the sea. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among them there are the following dif- <br>
  ferent types of women:--(<i>a</i>)<i>&nbsp;</i> First--let us <br>
  put them first--come a class of women who <br>
  hold, with minds otherwise unwarped, that <br>
  they may, whenever it is to their advantage, <br>
  lawfully resort to physical violence. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The programme, as distinguished from the <br>
  methods, of these women is not very different <br>
  from that of the ordinary suffragist woman. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>b</i>)&nbsp; There file past next a class of women
 <br>
  who have all their life-long been strangers to <br>
  joy, women in whom instincts long suppressed <br>
  have in the end broken into flame.&nbsp; These are <br>
  the sexually embittered women in whom every-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 169 <br>
  thing has turned into gall and bitterness of <br>
  heart, and hatred of men. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their legislative programme is license for <br>
  themselves, or else restrictions for man. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>c</i>)&nbsp; Next there file past the incomplete.
<br>
  One side of their nature has undergone atro- <br>
  phy, with the result that they have lost touch <br>
  with their living fellow men and women. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their programme is to convert the whole <br>
  world into an epicene institution--an epicene <br>
  institution in which man and woman shall <br>
  everywhere work side by side at the selfsame <br>
  tasks and for the selfsame pay. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These wishes can never by any possibility be <br>
  realised.&nbsp; Even in animals--I say <i>even,</i> be- <br>
  cause in these at least one of the sexes has <br>
  periods of complete quiscence--male and fe- <br>
  male cannot be safely worked side by side, ex- <br>
  cept when they are incomplete. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While in the human species safety can be <br>
  obtained, it can be obtained only at the price <br>
  of continual constraint.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 170 <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And even then woman, though she protests <br>
  that she does not require it, and that she does <br>
  not receive it, practically always does receive <br>
  differential treatment at the hands of man. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be well, I often think, that every <br>
  woman should be clearly told--and the woman <br>
  of the world will immediately understand-- <br>
  that when man sets his face against the pro- <br>
  posal to bring in an epicene world, he does so <br>
  because he can do his best work only in sur- <br>
  roundings where he is perfectly free from sug- <br>
  gestion and from restraint, and from the onus <br>
  which all differential treatment imposes. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I may add in connexion with my own <br>
  profession that when a medical man asks that <br>
  he should not be the yoke-fellow of a medical <br>
  woman he does so also because he would wish <br>
  to keep up as between men and women--even <br>
  when they are doctors--some of the modesties <br>
  and reticences upon which our civilisation has <br>
  been built up. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the medical woman is of course never&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 171 <br>
  on the side of modesty,<sup><font size="-2">1</font></sup> or in favour
of any <br>
  reticences.&nbsp; Her desire for knowledge does <br>
  not allow of these. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>d</i>)&nbsp; Inextricably mixed up with the types
<br>
  which we have been discussing is the type of <br>
  woman whom Dr. Leonard Williams's recent <br>
  letter brought so distinctly before our eyes-- <br>
  the woman who is poisoned by her misplaced <br>
  self-esteem; and who flies out at every man <br>
  who does not pay homage to her intellect. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is the woman who is affronted when a <br>
  man avers that <i>for him</i> the glory of woman lies <br>
  in her power of attraction, in her capacity for <br>
  motherhood, and in unswerving allegiance to <br>
  the ethics which are special to her sex. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have heard such an intellectually embit- <br>
  tered woman say, though she had been self- <br>
  denyingly taken to wife, that "never in the <br>
  whole course of her life had a man ever as much <br>
  as done her a kindness." </p>

<p><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><sup><font size="-2">1</font></sup><font size="-1">
   To those who have out of inadvertence and as laymen and</font> <br>
  <font size="-1">women misunderstood, it may be explained that the issue
here</font>  <br>
  <font size="-1">discussed is the second in order of the three which are
set out</font> <br>
  <font size="-1">on p. 139&nbsp; (<i>supra</i> ).</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 172 <br>
  &nbsp; </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The programme of this type of woman is, <br>
  as a preliminary, to compel man to admit her <br>
  claim to be his intellectual equal; and, that <br>
  done, to compel him to divide up everything <br>
  with her to the last farthing, and so make her <br>
  also his financial equal. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And her journals exhibit to us the kind of <br>
  parliamentary representative she desiderates. <br>

  from a knot of washerwomen standing arms <br>

  bittered human beings come troops of girls <br>
  just grown up. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All these will assure you, these young girls <br>
  --and what is seething in their minds is stir- <br>
  ring also in the minds in the girls in the col- <br>
  leges and schools which are staffed by un- <br>
  married suffragists--that woman has suffered <br>
  all manner of indignity and injustice at the <br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And these young girls have been told about <br>
  the intellectual, and moral, and financial value <br>
  of woman--such tales as it never entered into <br>
  the heart of man to conceive. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The programme of these young women is to <br>
  be married upon their own terms.&nbsp; Man shall <br>
  --so runs their scheme--work for their sup- <br>
  port--to that end giving up his freedom, and <br>
  putting himself under orders, for many hours <br>
  of the day; but they themselves must not be <br>
  asked to give up any of their liberty to him, <br>
  or to subordinate themselves to his interests, <br>
  or to obey him in anything. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To obey a man would be to commit the <br>
  unpardonable sin. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not necessary, in connexion with a <br>
  movement which proceeds on the lines set out <br>
  above, any further to labour the point that <br>
  there is in it an element of mental disorder. <br>
  It is plain that it is there. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also a quite fatuous element in the <br>
  programmes of the militant suffragist.&nbsp; We <br>
  have this element, for instance, in the doctrine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 174 <br>
  that, notwithstanding the fact that the con- <br>
  ditions of the labour market deny it to her, <br>
  woman ought to receive the same wage as a <br>
  man for the same work. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This doctrine is fatuous, because it leaves <br>
  out of sight that, even if woman succeeds in <br>
  doing the same work as man, he has behind him <br>
  a much larger reserve of physical strength. <br>
  As soon as a time of strain comes, areserve of <br>
  strength and freedom from periodic indisposi- <br>
  tion is worth paying extra for. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fatuous also is the dogma that woman <br>
  ought to have the same pay for the same work <br>
  --fatuous because it leaves out of sight that <br>
  woman's commercial value in many of the best <br>
  fields of work is subject to a very heavy dis- <br>
  count by reason of the fact that she cannot, <br>
  like a male employee, work cheek by jowl with <br>
  a male employer; nor work among men as a <br>
  man with his fellow employees. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So much for the woman suffragist's protest <br>
  that she can conceive of no reason for a dif- <br>
  ferential rate of pay for man.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 175 <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quite as fatuous are the marriage projects of <br>
  the militant suffragist.&nbsp; Every woman of the <br>
  world could tell her--whispering it into her <br>
  private ear--that if a sufficient number of men <br>
  should come to the conclusion that it was not <br>
  worth their while to marry except on the terms <br>
  of fair give-and-take, the suffragist woman's <br>
  demands would have to come down. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not at all certain that the institution of <br>
  matrimony--which, after all, is the great in- <br>
  strument in the levelling up of the financial <br>
  situation of woman--can endure apart from <br>
  some willing subordination on the part of the <br>
  wife. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will have been observed that there is in <br>
  these programmes, in addition to the element <br>
  of mental disorder and to the element of the <br>
  fatuous, which have been animadverted upon, <br>
  also a very ugly element of dishonesty.&nbsp; In <br>
  reality the very kernel of the militant suffrage <br>
  movement is the element of immorality. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is here not only immorality in the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 176 <br>
  ends which are in view, but also in the methods <br>
  adopted for the attainment of those ends. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may restrict ourselves to indicating <br>
  wherein lies the immorality of the methods. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no one who does not discern that <br>
  woman in her relations to physical force stands <br>
  in quite a different position to man. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of that different relation there must of <br>
  necessity shape itself a special code of ethics <br>
  for woman.&nbsp; And to violate that code must be <br>
  for woman immorality. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So far as I have seen, no one in this con- <br>
  troversy has laid his finger upon the essential <br>
  point in the relations of woman to physical <br>
  violence. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been stated--and in the main quite <br>
  truly stated--that woman in the mass cannot, <br>
  like man, back up her vote by bringing physi- <br>
  cal force into play. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the woman suffragist here counters by <br>
  insisting that she as an individual may have <br>
  more physical force than an individual man.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 177 <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it is quite certain--and it did not need <br>
  suffragist raids and window-breaking riots to <br>
  demonstrate it--that woman in the mass can <br>
  bring a certain amount of physical force to <br>
  bear. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The true inwardness of the relation in which <br>
  woman stands to physical force lies not in the <br>
  question of her having it at command, but in <br>
  the fact that she cannot put it forth without <br>
  placing herself within the jurisdiction of an <br>
  ethical law. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The law against which she offends when she <br>
  resorts to physical violence is not an ordinance <br>
  of man; it is not written in the statutes of any <br>
  State; it has not been enunciated by any hu- <br>
  man law-giver.&nbsp; It belongs to those unwritten, <br>
  and unassailable, and irreversible command- <br>
  ments of religion, [<i>Greek </i><sup><font size="-2">1<i> </i></font></sup>
  ], <br>
  which we suddenly and mysteriously become <br>
  aware of when we see them violated. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The law which the militant suffragist has <br>
  violated is among the ordinances of that code <br>
  which forbade us even to think of employing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>our native Indian troops against the Boers; <br>
  which brands it as an ignominy when a man <br>
  leaves his fellow in the lurch and saves his <br>
  own life; and which makes it an outrage for a <br>
  man to do violence to a woman. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To violate any ordinance of that code is <br>
  more dishonourable than to transgress every <br>
  statutory law. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We see acknowledgment of it in the fact <br>
  that even the uneducated man in the street <br>
  resents it as an outrage to civilisation when he <br>
  sees a man strike a blow at a woman. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But to the man who is committing the out- <br>
  rage it is a thing simply unaccountable that <br>
  any one should fly out at him. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In just such a case is the militant suffragist. <br>
  She cannot understand why any one should <br>
  think civilisation is outraged when she scuffles <br>
  in the street mud with a policeman. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If she asks for an explanation, it perhaps <br>
  behoves a man to supply it. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Up to the present in the whole civilised world <br>
  there has ruled a truce of God as between man&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 179 <br>
  and woman.&nbsp; That truce is based upon the <br>
  solemn covenant that within the frontiers of <br>
  civilisation (outside them of course the rule <br>
  lapses) the weapon of physical force may not <br>
  be applied by man against woman; nor by <br>
  woman against man. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under this covenant, the reign of force <br>
  which prevails in the world without comes to <br>
  an end when a man enters his household. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under this covenant that half of the human <br>
  race which most needs protection is raised up <br>
  above the waves of violence. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the terms of this compact everything <br>
  that woman has received from man, and every- <br>
  thing man receives from woman, is given as a <br>
  free gift. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, under this covenant a full half of the <br>
  programme of Christianity has been realised; <br>
  and a foundation has been laid upon which it <br>
  may be possible to build higher; and perhaps <br>
  finally in the ideal future to achieve the aboli- <br>
  tion of physical violence and war. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it is this solemn covenant, the covenant&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 180 <br>
  so faithfully kept by man, which has been <br>
  violated by the militant suffragist in the in- <br>
  terest of her morbid, stupid, ugly, and dis- <br>
  honest programmes. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it wonder if men feel that they have had <br>
  enough of the militant suffragist, and that the <br>
  State would be well rid of her if she were <br>
  crushed under the soldiers' shields like the <br>
  traitor woman at the Tarpeian rock [in ancient Rome where traitors were
killed] ? <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may turn now to that section of woman <br>
  suffragists--one is almost inclined to doubt <br>
  whether it any longer exists--which is opposed <br>
  to all violent measures, though it numbers in <br>
  its ranks women who are stung to the quick <br>
  by the thought that man, who will concede the <br>
  vote to the lowest and most degraded of his <br>
  own sex, withholds it from "even the noblest <br>
  woman in England." <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When that excited and somewhat pathetic <br>
  appeal is addressed to us, we have only to con- <br>
  sider what a vote really gives. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The parliamentary vote is an instrument-- <br>
  and a quite astonishly disappointing instru-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 181 <br>
  ment it is--for obtaining legislation; that is, <br>
  for directing that the agents of the State shall <br>
  in certain defined circumstances bring into ap- <br>
  plication the weapon of physical compulsion. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, the vote is an instrument by which <br>
  we give to this or that group of statesmen an- <br>
  thority to supervise and keep in motion the <br>
  whole machinery of compulsion. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To take examples.&nbsp; A vote cast in favour <br>
  of a Bill for the prohibition of alcohol--if we <br>
  could find opportunity for giving a vote on <br>
  such a question--would be a formal expression <br>
  of our desire to apply, through the agency of <br>
  the paid servants of the State, that same physi- <br>
  cal compulsion which Mrs. Carrie Nation put <br>
  into application in her "bar-smashing" cru- <br>
  sades. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a vote which puts a Government into <br>
  office in a country where murder is punishable <br>
  by death is a vote which, by agency of the <br>
  hangman, puts the noose round the neck of <br>
  every convicted murderer. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that the difference between voting and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 182 <br>
  direct resort to force is simply the difference <br>
  between exerting physical violence in person, <br>
  and exerting it through the intermediary of <br>
  an agent of the State. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The thing, therefore, that is withheld from <br>
  "the noblest woman in England," while it is <br>
  conceded to the man who is lacking in nobility <br>
  of character, is in the end only an instrument <br>
  by which she might bring into application <br>
  physical force. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When one realises that that same noblest <br>
  woman of England would shrink from any <br>
  personal exercise of violence, one would have <br>
  thought that it would have come home to her <br>
  that it is not precisely her job to commission <br>
  a man forcibly to shut up a public-house, or <br>
  to hang a murderer. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One cannot help asking oneself whether, if <br>
  she understood what a vote really means, the <br>
  noblest woman in England would still go on <br>
  complaining of the bitter insult which is done <br>
  to her in withholding the vote. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the opportunist--the practical politi-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 183 <br>
  cian, as he calls himself--will perhaps here in- <br>
  tervene, holding some such language as this: <br>
  --"Granting all you say, granting, for the sake <br>
  of argument, that the principle of giving votes <br>
  to woman is unsound, and that evil must ulti- <br>
  mately come of it, how can you get over the <br>
  fact that no very conspicuous harm has re- <br>
  sulted from woman suffrage in the countries <br>
  which have adopted it?&nbsp; And can any firm <br>
  reasons be rendered for the belief that the giv- <br>
  ing of votes to women in England would be <br>
  any whit more harmful than in the Colo- <br>
  nies?" <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A very few words will supply the answer.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The evils of woman suffrage lie, <i>first,</i> in the
<br>
  fact that to give the vote to women is to give <br>
  it to voters who as a class are quite incom- <br>
  petent to adjudicate upon political issues; <br>
  <i>secondly,</i> in the fact that women are a class of <br>
  voters who cannot effectively back up their <br>
  votes by force; and, <i>thirdly,</i> in the fact that <br>
  it may seriously embroil man and woman. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first two aspects of the question have&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 184 <br>
  already in this controversy been adequately <br>
  dealt with.&nbsp; There remains the last issue. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the point of view of this issue the con- <br>
  ditions which we have to deal with in this coun- <br>
  try are the absolute antithesis of those ruling <br>
  in any of the countries and States which have <br>
  adopted woman suffrage. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When woman suffrage was adopted in these <br>
  countries it was adopted in some for one <br>
  reason, in others for another.&nbsp; In some it was <br>
  adopted because it appealed to the<i> doctrinaire [theoretical]</i> <br>
  politician as the proper logical outcome of a <br>
  democratic and Socialistic policy.&nbsp; In others <br>
  it was adopted because opportunist politicians <br>
  saw in it an instrument by which they might <br>
  gain electioneering advantages.&nbsp; So much was <br>
  this the case that it sometimes happened that <br>
  the woman's vote was sprung upon a com- <br>
  munity which was quite unprepared and in- <br>
  different to it. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cause of woman suffrage was thus in <br>
  the countries of which we speak neither in its <br>
  inception nor in its realisation a question of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 185 <br>
  revolt of woman against the oppression of <br>
  man.&nbsp; It had, and has, no relation to the pro- <br>
  grammes of the militant suffragists as set out <br>
  at the outset of this letter. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By virtue of this, all the evils which spring <br>
  from the embroiling of man and woman have <br>
  in the countries in question been conspicuously <br>
  absent. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of seeing himself confronted by a <br>
  section of embittered and hostile women voters <br>
  which might at any time outvote him and help <br>
  to turn an election, man there sees his women <br>
  folk voting practically everywhere in accord- <br>
  ance with his directions, and lending him a <br>
  hand to outvote his political opponent. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether or no such voting is for the good <br>
  of the common weal is beside our present ques- <br>
  tion.&nbsp; But it is clearly an arrangement which <br>
  leads to amity and peace between a man and <br>
  his womenkind, and through these to good-will <br>
  towards all women. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In England everything is different. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If woman suffrage comes in here, it will&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 186 <br>
  have come as a surrender to a very violent <br>
  feminist agitation--an agitation which we have <br>
  traced back to our excess female population <br>
  and the associated abnormal physiological con- <br>
  ditions. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If ever Parliament concedes the vote to <br>
  woman in England, it will be accepted by the <br>
  militant suffragist, not as an eirenicon, but as a <br>
  victory which she will value only for the better <br>
  carrying on of her fight <i>&agrave; outrance</i> <i>[to the bitter end]</i>
   against the <br>
  oppression and injustice of man. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A conciliation with hysterical revolt is <br>
  neither an act of peace; nor will it bring <br>
  peace. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor would the conferring of the vote upon <br>
  women carry with it any advantages from the <br>
  point of view of finding a way out of the ma- <br>
  terial entanglements in which woman is en- <br>
  meshed, and thus ending the war between man <br>
  and woman. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One has only to ask oneself whether or not <br>
  it would help the legislator in remodelling the <br>
  divorce or the bastardy laws if he had con-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 187 <br>
  joined with him an unmarried militant suf- <br>
  fragist as assessor. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peace will come again.&nbsp; It will come when <br>
  woman ceases to believe and to teach all man- <br>
  ner of evil of man despitefully.&nbsp; It will come <br>
  when she ceases to impute to him as a crime her <br>
  own natural disabilities, when she ceases to <br>
  resent the fact that man cannot and does not <br>
  wish to work side by side with her.&nbsp; And peace <br>
  will return when every woman for whom there <br>
  is no room in England seeks "rest" beyond the <br>
  sea, "each one in the house of her husband," and <br>
  when the woman who remains in England <br>
  comes to recognise that she can, without sacri- <br>
  fice of dignity, give a willing subordination to <br>
  the husband or father, who, when all is said <br>
  and done, earns and lays up money for her. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
